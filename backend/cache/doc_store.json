Inthis\\r\\npaper, we propose the distributed security operation center (DSOC) that provides the distributed\\r\\nworking mechanism for multiple organizations over the wide area network by combining their\\r\\nsecurity probes.  The security probes of DSOC are deployed in the di\\u001berent organizations to\\r\\ncollect data and the collected data is transferred over wide area network to the data analysis center\\r\\nof the DSOC. Especially, the data communication between security probes and data analysis center\\r\\nis encrypted to ensure the data security of every organization. The data analysis center adopts rule-\\r\\nbased, AI-based and threat intelligence-based algorithms to detect cyber-attacks. The detection\\r\\nresults are input into the automated response module in the DSOC. The automated response\\r\\nmodule is the client-server structure and the client are installed in the security probe. The server\\r\\nof the automated response sends commands across the wide area network to the target client of the\\r\\nsecurity probe to block the attackers quickly, and meanwhile the communication between client\\r\\nand server in the response processes is encrypted. In addition, the threat intelligence component\\r\\nof DSOC can aggregation intelligence from the organizations and easily share this intelligence\\r\\nwith all organizations based on the distributed security probes. The DSOC also builds the security\\r\\nsituational awareness system that visualizes the cyber threats of every organization and set the\\r\\npermissiontoviewthesecuritysituationbyusingaccesscontrolforeveryorganization.

Introduction\\r\\nIHEP su\\u001bers frequent attacks by adversaries with di\\u001berent agendas. To minimize cybersecurity\\r\\nrisks and improve the security operations of IHEP, we have created the Security Operation Center\\r\\n(SOC) in 2021 in IHEP [1], which is a centralized defense group in IHEP based on \\u001cve data pro-\\r\\ncessing layers: data collection, data preprocessing, data storage, data analysis and data application.\\r\\nHowever, the current SOC setup is mainly used for ensuring the network security of one site and\\r\\nis insu\\u001ecient to defend against cyber-attacks for several collaborative large scienti\\u001cc facilities and\\r\\nscienti\\u001cc data centers across the wide area network.\\r\\nIn this paper, a distributed SOC (DSOC) is proposed which can protect several sites from cyber\\r\\nthreats and achieve coordinated operation among multiple sites across the wide area network. The\\r\\nproposed DSOC has three features:\\r\\n•Multiprobe distributed framework: The proposed DSOC contains a data analysis center in\\r\\nIHEP and a few security probes in the sites. The data analysis center interacts with security\\r\\nprobes in client-server mode and integrates data from several sites to achieve multi-site\\r\\ncollaboration.\\r\\n•Multi-function security probe: The security probe can support network tra\\u001ec and security\\r\\nlogs collection, and perform automatic response at the sites by combining data from the\\r\\ncentral data analysis center and security devices of sites. In addition, threat intelligence can\\r\\nbe quickly shared with several sites by using security probe.\\r\\n•Centralized data analysis: The data analysis center can centralize analysis of all site data and\\r\\ndetect known and unknown attacks in the speci\\u001cc security scenarios by rule-based methods\\r\\nand machine learning algorithms.\\r\\n2.  Related work\\r\\nSecurity Operations Centers (SOCs) have been created by many organizations or enterprises\\r\\nas e\\u001bective cybersecurity monitoring solutions. D. Crooks presents a minimum viable security\\r\\noperation senter for the modern grid environment[2, 3]. This security operation senter reference\\r\\ndesign is based on 4 di\\u001berent stages: data sources and threat intelligence, data pipelines, storage\\r\\nand visualisation, alerting. Besides, Bidou presents the implementation of a completely integrated\\r\\nsecurity operation center (SOC), called SOCBox in order to overcome the limitations of IDS[4, 5].\\r\\nInaddition, Ganame[6]presentsseveralmethodsusedtotesttheaccuracyandtheperformanceofthe\\r\\nSOCBox. Miloslavskaya [7] presents security information center to empower information security\\r\\nmanagement for intranets all organizations. Radu [8] proposes a few architectural considerations\\r\\nregarding frameworks and operating models that can be used when building a variably sized SOC.\\r\\nThe SOC framework is proposed comprising log collection, analysis, incident response, reporting,\\r\\npersonnel and continuous monitoring [9\\u001512].  Settani[13] proposes a system architecture for a\\r\\nnational SOC, de\\u001cning the functional components and interfaces it comprises.  Tafazzoli [14]\\r\\ncustomizes SOC for OpenStack environment to detect cloud speci\\u001cc attacks. The customized SOC\\r\\nreceives and normalizes OpenStack alerts. The above mentioned SOC setup is mainly used for\\r\\nensuring the network security of one organization or enterprise.\\r\\n2\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"J2DmmucscoyfP5f53Dga1M0wrReRizndyAAHrqOkzLA=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf_3":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf_3\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nPoS(ISGC&HEPiX2023)026\\r\\nA distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy PhysicsJiarong Wang\\r\\nIn order to defend against cyber-attacks for several collaborative organizations or enterprises\\r\\nacross the wide area network, the distributed SOC is more appropriate. The Splunk can analyse\\r\\nand manage logs from multi-customer based on the Splunk agents and universal forwarders. In\\r\\naddition, the commercial NGSOC[15], T-sec[16], and ISOP[17] can provide the security operations\\r\\nfor several organizations by using several probes. However, during the trial process of these products\\r\\nin IHEP, it was found that there were problems such as high deployment and maintenance costs,\\r\\ninsu\\u001ecient scalability, data security risks, and insu\\u001ecient timeliness of response, which could not\\r\\nfully meet the needs of security operations in IHEP.\\r\\n3.  Key techniques of the distributed SOC\\r\\n3.1 The distributed framework\\r\\nThe proposed distributed framework includes a server and a few clients. The client is the\\r\\nsecurity probe deployed in every site and the server is the data analysis center deployed in IHEP.\\r\\nAll the sites within the framework are highly collaborative and have mutual trust. To ensure data\\r\\nsecurity, the transmission between the client and the server is protected. The framework is shown\\r\\nin \\u001cgure 1.\\r\\nFigure 1:The distributed framework\\r\\nThe functions of security probe mainly include data collection and data application. The data\\r\\napplication include automatic response and intelligence sharing. The collected data of the security\\r\\nprobes are encrypted and transmitted to the server.  The server then analyzes all site data and\\r\\nprocesses these data in the threat intelligence platform, the situation awareness system, the threat\\r\\ndetection and the response services. The comparation between the original SOC and the DSOC\\r\\nbased on the aforementioned \\u001cve data processing sections is shown in \\u001cgure 2.

For example, the brute force attack detection for login servers counts the number of login\\r\\nfailures, and if the number is larger than the threshold, the login IP address is detected as a malicious\\r\\nIP.

These methods apply multiple instance learning to achieve\\r\\nthe \\u001cne-grained classi\\u001ccation of network tra\\u001ec. The experiment results have demonstrated our\\r\\ndetection methods are better than the state-of-the-art detection systems[23, 24].\\r\\n3.5 Automatic response\\r\\nThe automatic response leverages agent and server components to handle the malicious IP\\r\\naddresses detected by the data analysis methods.

In addition, we adopt dynamic\\r\\nblocking strategy which includes 6 blocking levels: 4 hours, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year,\\r\\ninde\\u001cnitely respectively.\\r\\n3.6 Threat intelligence\\r\\nThe functions of the threat intelligence platform can be classi\\u001ced as four parts. The \\u001crst part\\r\\nis threat intelligence collection which aggregates threat intelligence from two sources. One source\\r\\nis the malicious IP database which stores the detected and blocked IP addresses from all sites. The\\r\\nother source is the security related websites which post the malicious IP dataset periodically such\\r\\nas structured data feeds. The second part of the threat intelligence platform is threat intelligence\\r\\nstorage which builds a graph database [25] to store the collected threat intelligence based on the\\r\\nSTIX standard [26]. The third part is threat intelligence sharing in which security probes pull threat\\r\\nintelligence from the threat intelligence database. The last part is the threat intelligence application\\r\\nwhich uses the malicious IP for the threat detection and automatic blocking.\\r\\n3.7 Security situation awareness\\r\\nThe security situation awareness can provide the overview of security status of every site by\\r\\nvisualizing several statistics, such as the number of threats, the trends of threats, and the origins\\r\\nof threats. The used technologies include Django framework [27], Vue.js [28] and Echarts [29].\\r\\nMeanwhile, the access control strategy is set up to ensure the data security so that one site can't\\r\\nview the security status of other sites.\\r\\n4.  Applications\\r\\nThe DSOC has been applied to institute of high energy physics (IHEP) and deployed in 4\\r\\ncollaborative large scienti\\u001cc facilities and 3 scienti\\u001cc data centers. The number of site data types\\r\\ncollected and analyzed in the DSOC system is 9 as shown in \\u001cgure 6.\\r\\nFor the authentication data of sites such as secure shell (SSH) logs, single sign-on (SSO) logs\\r\\nand mail system logs, the DSOC can send alert emails to the user after a detection of an unusual\\r\\nlogin to his account. For example, a user's email account was leaked because of phishing mail. And\\r\\nthen the intruder logged into his account at mid-night. The DSOC detected the unusual login and\\r\\nsent an alert email to the user. This user read our notice in the morning and changed his password.\\r\\nFor the security alerts logs such as network intrusion detection system (NIDS), host intrusion\\r\\ndetection system (HIDS), web application \\u001crewall (WAF) and intrusion prevention system (IPS),\\r\\nthe DSOC can \\u001clter 99% false positives and perform automatic response. For example, the DSOC\\r\\ncounts the number of backdoor attacks and compares with a threshold. If the number is larger than\\r\\nthe threshold, the attack IP of backdoor attack is blocked automatically.\\r\\nIn addition, the DSOC also analyzes DNS logs of sites to detect DNS \\u001dood attack. The DSOC\\r\\n\\u001crstly counts the number of DNS queries. If the number is larger than the threshold, the DNS \\u001dood\\r\\nattack is detected and the attack IP is blocked automatically if the queries are from the external IP,\\r\\nbut if the queries are from the internal IP, the DSOC sends alerts emails to security manager to\\r\\nhandle.\\r\\n6\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"2LG895p4ucmTjIc377qJUC3o63NUn4OZzv+2G3mdsvU=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf_7":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf_7\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":7,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nPoS(ISGC&HEPiX2023)026\\r\\nA distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy PhysicsJiarong Wang\\r\\nNgsoc\\u0003(network\\u0003intrusion\\u0003\\r\\ndetection\\u0003system)\\r\\nKafka\\r\\nThreshold\\u0003detection\\r\\nAutomatic\\u0003blocking\\r\\nZeek\\u0003\\r\\nLog\\u0003server\\r\\nAlerts\\u0003statistics\\r\\nCDN\\u0003extraction\\r\\nwhitelist\\r\\nBlacklist\\u0003\\r\\nLogin\\u0003server\\r\\nAbnormal\\u0003DNS\\u0003detection\\u0003\\r\\nWAF\\u0003(Web\\u0003application\\u0003\\r\\nfirewall)\\r\\nAttackers\\u0003\\r\\nLog4j2\\u0003detection\\r\\nPreprocessing\\u0003\\r\\nOverview\\u0003of\\u0003\\r\\nsecurity\\u0003status\\r\\nTian\\u0003(Host\\u0003Intrusion\\u0003\\r\\nDetection\\u0003System)\\r\\nHTTP\\u0003traffic\\u0003logs\\r\\nDNS\\u0003traffic\\u0003logs\\r\\nLogin\\u0003logs\\r\\nAlerts\\u0003logs\\r\\nIPS\\u0003(Intrusion\\u0003prevention\\u0003\\r\\nsystem)\\r\\nEmail\\u0003server\\r\\nSSO\\u0003(Single\\u0003signͲon)\\u0003server\\r\\nLogstash\\r\\nAttacks\\u0003statistics\\r\\nSend\\u0003alert\\u0003\\r\\nemailsBrute\\u0003force\\u0003\\r\\ndetection\\r\\nAbnormal\\u0003login\\u0003\\r\\ndetection\\r\\nDNS\\u0003serverDNS\\u0003logs\\r\\nDNS\\u0003flood\\u0003detection\\r\\nWhitelist\\u0003filter\\r\\nElasticsearch\\r\\nSQL\\r\\nData\\u0003monitoring\\u0003=0\\r\\nData\\r\\nStorage\\r\\nAnalysis\\r\\nApplication\\r\\nServers\\r\\nFigure 6:Data \\u001dow diagram for the DSOC in IHEP\\r\\nThe automatic blocking of sites has 4 steps in general. For example, the automatic blocking\\r\\napplied in China National Genomics Data Center (NGDC) includes: 1) security probe in NGDC\\r\\nsends the IPS, WAF and \\u001crewall logs; 2) data analysis center aggregates logs and extracts the\\r\\nmalicious IP; 3) security probe pulls the malicious IP by the https protocol; 4) security probe\\r\\noperates the IPS in NGDC to block the malicious IP. The blocking strategy in site NGDC is set as\\r\\nblocking for 4 hours.\\r\\nIn total, the number of attack types identi\\u001ced by the DSOC is 12 and there are 6 blocking levels\\r\\napplied for di\\u001berent attack types. The \\u001cgure 7 shows the attack types and the number of blocked IP\\r\\naddresses in 2022.\\r\\nThe DSOC has provided situation awareness for 7 sites.

Owning a Security Operation Center (SOC) is becoming \\r\\nincreasingly common for organizations as part of their cybersecurity \\r\\nstrategy to ensure near-real-time detection and adequately respond to \\r\\ncyber-attack engaging the SOC’s humans, technology, and processes. \\r\\nHowever, SOC investments only sometimes achieve the best possible \\r\\noutcomes and only provide an acceptable protection level in some cases \\r\\ndue to the challenges related to the technologies, processes and especially \\r\\nthe human factor. This paper proposes a new practical maturity framework \\r\\nfor Security Operation Center. This will serve as a roadmap for IT auditors \\r\\nand security experts when they evaluate the maturity of a security \\r\\noperation center in terms of safeguarding the assets of the company, its \\r\\npartners, and its clients.\\r\\nINTRODUCTION\\r\\nSecurity operations centers should be analyzed as a management \\r\\ntool for the continuity and quality of the organizations’ opera-\\r\\ntions. Their inclusion in their organizational structure will allow \\r\\norganizations to achieve their strategic objectives. It should be \\r\\nborne in mind that the dissemination of the use of Information \\r\\nand Communication Technologies (ICT) has changed our daily \\r\\nactivities and how we interact with each other as individuals \\r\\nand with companies, organizations and governmental entities, \\r\\norganizations and governmental entities.\\r\\nThis increased use of systems, technologies, and communica-\\r\\ntions leads to an increase in cyber threats that take advantage of \\r\\nvulnerabilities to obtain economic benefit through the theft of \\r\\nmoney, money laundering, and financial benefit through the \\r\\ntheft of money or intellectual benefit through patent infringe-\\r\\nment. patents. This problem has led to the emergence of the com-\\r\\nputer science field, the area of the study of computer security, \\r\\nwhose objective is to guarantee the integrity, confidentiality, and \\r\\nIN THIS ISSUE \\r\\nn A MATURITY CAPABILITY \\r\\nFRAMEWORK FOR \\r\\nSECURITY OPERATION \\r\\nCENTER\\r\\nEditor DAN SWANSON \\r\\nEditor Emeritus BELDEN MENKUS, CISA\\r\\nCELEBRATING OVER 4 DECADES OF PUBLICATION!\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"+SUtuyHtdhP0bE5dz4J1UAUfPXS3bcl2C89VzOB8C7Q=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/A MATURITY CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITY OPERATION CENTER.pdf_3":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/A MATURITY CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITY OPERATION CENTER.pdf_3\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\A MATURITY CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITY OPERATION CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"A MATURITY CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITY OPERATION CENTER.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\navailability of the data and availability of data and processing \\r\\nsystems (Miloslavskaya, 2018).\\r\\nComputer security requires a combination of technical knowledge \\r\\nof all computer platforms and management knowledge to articulate \\r\\ndevices, technologies, advanced detection systems, processes, and \\r\\npeople. In this way, it will be possible to effectively and sustainably \\r\\nprotect the assets of interest to the organization (Maleh, 2018).\\r\\nA SOC is a team of security experts in charge of monitoring, \\r\\ndetecting, analyzing and qualifying security events. This team \\r\\nensures the management of appropriate reactions to proven secur-\\r\\nity incidents. For some organizations, this team administers and \\r\\ncontrols the day-to-day management of security systems and mea-\\r\\nsures; for example, the “hardening” of standard operating systems \\r\\nto reinforce their security, or the management of accreditations \\r\\n(access rights to resources) or even the management of “patch \\r\\nmanagement.” In direct support of the business and partnership \\r\\nwith IT services, a SOC aims to reduce the duration and the impact \\r\\nof security incidents that take advantage of, disrupt, prevent, \\r\\ndegrade or destroy systems dedicated to standard operations. \\r\\nThis is achieved through effective monitoring and tracking of inci-\\r\\ndents from end to end. The SOC is responsible, on the one hand, for \\r\\ndeclaring that there is indeed an incident on the IS, and, on the \\r\\nother hand, it is responsible for conducting the operations that will \\r\\nenable it to declare the incident closed. From an operational point \\r\\nof view, it is the combination of the SOC and CERT/C-SIRT entities \\r\\nthat ensures the resolution of an incident (Maleh, 2021).\\r\\nThe overall objective of the paper is to demonstrate that \\r\\na security operations center (SOC) is a management solution to \\r\\nthe problem of cyber defense. To achieve the general objective, it \\r\\nwill be necessary to address the first specific objective, which is to \\r\\nintroduce security operations, including the reasons behind creat-\\r\\ning a SOC and its services. Then we will move on to the second \\r\\nspecific objective, which is to explain the triad of processes, people \\r\\nand technologies, whose synergy and interaction support the man-\\r\\nagement of a SOC. Finally, the third specific objective will be devel-\\r\\noped to outline the strategy for creating a maturity model for SOC.\\r\\nBACKGROUND\\r\\nThere needs to be more literature on security operations centers. \\r\\nOnly a few studies on security operations centers have been pub-\\r\\nlished in the past ten years. Most of the material about security \\r\\noperations centers is based on presentations and blogs from \\r\\nsecurity vendors and best practices. There are few studies on \\r\\nsecurity operations centers (Chamkar, 2022).\\r\\nThe first-generation security operation centers were created in \\r\\nthe early years of the internet. Antivirus software and firewalls \\r\\nwere the initial security elements. Monitoring these elements and \\r\\ntaking appropriate action in the event of potential threats or events \\r\\nwas the responsibility of the security operation center, which was \\r\\noften a single person in those days. The fifth generation of security \\r\\noperation centers, which concentrate on processing massive data \\r\\nsets, has developed over time. This emphasis also covers the busi-\\r\\nness environment and corporate hazards (Hewlett Packard, 2013).\\r\\nEDPACS                                                                  2022\\r\\n22 „ Copyright 2022 Taylor & Francis–All rights reserved.\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"nasaYp/KAURDwJqtkZ+MGGdIFWl0F7lm/qT+EvC6QrE=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/A MATURITY CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITY OPERATION CENTER.pdf_4":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/A MATURITY CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITY OPERATION CENTER.pdf_4\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":4,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\A MATURITY CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITY OPERATION CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"A MATURITY CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITY OPERATION CENTER.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nThe 2013 Hewlett Packard paper offers important details on the \\r\\nobjectives of a security operation center.

Hoffman (2014, p. 5) made an intriguing point on the \\r\\nbreadth of the security operations center. A security operations \\r\\ncenter’s initial emphasis was on perimeter security.

The \\r\\ndata center task is also a data service organization that needs to \\r\\ndo data publishing services among their stakeholders. The \\r\\nchallenging task for the Security Operation Center (SOC) team \\r\\nis to analyze all security risks such as data breaches. Most cases \\r\\nof data breach problems are overlooked cases that occur \\r\\nindirectly by guessing from other prior knowledge. For \\r\\nexample, attackers combine our dataset with other data sets to \\r\\nreidentify personal data. This attack is called a re-Identification \\r\\nattack that causes a data breach. To fix the risk, statistical noise \\r\\ncontrol techniques for data anonymization are explored and \\r\\nimplemented in this study. A Cell-key perturbation is to fix the \\r\\nattack without modifying an original dataset but return an \\r\\nanswer dataset with noise addition per query instead.  \\r\\nKeywords— data privacy, security operation center, cell-key \\r\\nperturbation, data anonymization \\r\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\r\\nThe UK Statistics and Registration Services Act's \\r\\nresponsibility is to produce official statistics and ensure good \\r\\npractice usage of statistics. In these acts (2007), “personal \\r\\ninformation” is information that identifies directly or \\r\\nindirectly a particular person. Data privacy laws such as \\r\\nGDPR [18] in Europe and PDPA [19] in Thailand are both \\r\\nlaws to protect personal data. Since then, data privacy has \\r\\nbecome a hot topic in many countries.  \\r\\nThe difference between data security and data privacy is \\r\\n‘Who’ can access data in data security and ‘when and what \\r\\ncan they access data in data privacy. For example, login \\r\\nauthentication term in data security is about ‘Who’ can access \\r\\nbut Authorization in data privacy is about ‘what’ and ‘when’ \\r\\nof data that the user is accessible. Therefore, data privacy is a \\r\\ntask for the SOC team rather than an individual system \\r\\nadministrator.  \\r\\nAccording to The National Institute of Standards and \\r\\nTechnology Framework (NIST), it is almost inevitable for a \\r\\nfirm to have a data breach. This paper intends to propose a \\r\\nnew framework for mitigating a data breach effect. Thailand \\r\\nPDPA laws argue the data controller to notify the data breach \\r\\nincident within 72 hours after detecting the event.  \\r\\nThe basic approach to preventing data breaches is to hide \\r\\nPersonal Identifier Information (PII) from being exposed by \\r\\nothers without permission. For example, all PIIs are separately \\r\\nstored on different tables. Unfortunately, the datasets that \\r\\nexclude PII combined with other knowledge can reveal \\r\\nunintentionally the personal data. Because data breach causes \\r\\nserious problem by-laws, this research proposed a new \\r\\nframework to protect personal data and comply with privacy \\r\\nlaws. For example, attackers combine our dataset with other \\r\\ndata sets to reidentify personal data. This attack is called a re-\\r\\nIdentification risk [9] that causes a data breach.  \\r\\nData center becomes a data controller or data processor by \\r\\nGDPR/PDPA laws because it holds a lot of personal data. \\r\\nPDPA is a new data privacy law in Thailand. The riskiest data \\r\\ncontroller is a data breach. The simple way of protecting data \\r\\nis cyber security, but there is no guarantee for data privacy. \\r\\nThe incident response model was developed based on the \\r\\nprocedures and policies that were implemented within the \\r\\ninstitution. Once an incident happens, the SOC has to team \\r\\ndetermine the adjustments needed for the controls that will be \\r\\nimplemented in different processes whether for technical or \\r\\nnontechnical aspects.  \\r\\nFig. 1. RSU Incident Management Process \\r\\nFigure 1 shows the RSU incident management process that \\r\\nhandles some serious incidents such as data breaches. By \\r\\nThailand law, the data controller has to report the data owner \\r\\nwithin 72 hours. The first step is to set up an analyst team who \\r\\ncan do data analytics to find the root causes of incidents. This \\r\\npaper  focuses  on  data  breaches  by  using  data from an \\r\\nanonymizer server shown in Figure 3. \\r\\nA.Cell-key Perturbation Methodology\\r\\nSweeney [9] introduced a re-identification risk. The quasi-\\r\\nidentifier of {age, zip code, and date of birth} can re-identify \\r\\nmany personal data [16].  There are two main concepts to \\r\\nprevent a reidentification risks such as K-anonymity [9] and \\r\\nCell-key perturbation [20].  \\r\\nA cell-key perturbation (CKP) method was developed by \\r\\nthe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in 2021. The origin \\r\\npurpose is developed for the census.  \\r\\nA perturbation method that is one of the new data privacy \\r\\nconcepts adds noise to frequency tables. The noise calculates \\r\\nfrom every cell value. It is more practical and faster to produce \\r\\na  privacy  dataset  and  is  also  recommended  by  the  UK \\r\\n979-8-3503-0050-5/23/$31.00 ©2023 IEEE\\r\\nThe 20th International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE2023)\\r\\n190\\r\\n2023 20th International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE) | 979-8-3503-0050-5/23/$31.00 ©2023 IEEE | DOI: 10.1109/JCSSE58229.2023.10202111\\r\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember.

Rather than using the data swapping technique, \\r\\nthe Cell Key Perturbation Methodology is much faster. \\r\\nThe CKP method adds a small amount of noise to some \\r\\ncells in a table, meaning that users cannot be sure whether \\r\\ndifferences between tables  represent  a  real  person,  or  are \\r\\ncaused  by  the perturbation. The  method is  consistent  and \\r\\nrepeatable, so the same cells are always perturbed in the same \\r\\nway [4]. \\r\\nCell Key Perturbation Methodology is to add statical noise \\r\\nto a dataset that can be reidentified. The key concept is to \\r\\nmake a long time for attackers to reveal their original personal \\r\\ndata. \\r\\n \\r\\nFig. 2. Frequency count on quasi-identifier \\r\\nFigure 2 shows a re-identification risk on the frequency of \\r\\ngroup 1 by using the group-by command. Attackers can guess \\r\\nwho they are if they are unique. A simple group-by-command \\r\\ncannot reveal all other dimensions; therefore, a Perturbation \\r\\ntable or P-table is invented for multidimensional calculation. \\r\\nA perturbation table applied to a cell is a frequency table that \\r\\ncounts a group of attributes. Such a P-table can be obtained \\r\\nusing the R-package P-table [3]. \\r\\nThe record keys are random values for each record. When \\r\\ncalculating a table cell, these record keys will be combined \\r\\ninto a cell key. The noise added is based on a cell’s value and \\r\\na ‘cell key’ calculated for each cell. Cell key values are not \\r\\nunique and the same noise can be added to multiple cells. It is \\r\\nimportant to note that the noise is not added randomly: if the \\r\\nsame query is run multiple times, the query will always be \\r\\nperturbed in the same way. \\r\\nIn order to apply the cell key method, a microdata file must \\r\\nbe  supplied  containing  categorical  data.  An  unperturbed \\r\\nfrequency table is generated based on the variables defined, \\r\\nthen a ‘cell key’ for each value is calculated by summing the \\r\\nrecord keys - integers randomly assigned to each row - from \\r\\nthe contributing rows in the source microdata. A lookup is \\r\\nthen performed on a perturbation table such as a CSV file \\r\\ncontaining a list of perturbation values specifying how much \\r\\nnoise  should  be  applied  to  a  cell.  The  final  output  is  a \\r\\nperturbed frequency table that is no longer disclosive. \\r\\nB. Anonymizer server \\r\\nA firewall is normally a hardware for a firm to protect an \\r\\norganization's assets from hackers. It acts like a gatekeeper \\r\\nthat let only authorized connection pass in a network. This \\r\\nequipment is vital for every network to distinguish between \\r\\nthe internet world and the intranet world. \\r\\nThis paper proposed a new architecture that uses a firewall \\r\\nas a division line. The Anonymizer server in Figure 2 is a \\r\\nserver in front of the firewall. After the firewall, there is a PII \\r\\nsegment that contains all sensitive personal information. The \\r\\nother non-PII segment is stored separately. Both tables are \\r\\nlinked with the primary key hashed function and stored behind \\r\\na firewall. The preparation process is discussed in section 3.  \\r\\nThe  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Some  previous \\r\\nliterature is reviewed  in  section  2.  Section  3  shows  a \\r\\ndemonstration  of  the  research  methodology.  Section  4 \\r\\ndescribes the data preparation process. Section 5 reveals the \\r\\nexperimental result. Section 6 is Future Work. Finally, in \\r\\nSection 7, we describe the conclusion of the study. \\r\\nII. LITERATURE REVIEW \\r\\nM. Mutemwa, J. Mtsweni, and L. Zimba [1] stated that \\r\\nSOCs' responsibilities are to detect, investigate and report on \\r\\nall malicious activities that occur. \\r\\nHebert Silva et al. [2] demonstrated and reaffirmed that \\r\\neven de-identified data that removed all direct personal data is \\r\\nnot enough to protect against re-identification  risk. Prior \\r\\nknowledge  combined  with  dataset  can  reidentify  personal \\r\\ninformation easily [2]. \\r\\nT. Enderle and S. Giessing [3]  developed “Open Source \\r\\ntools for perturbative confidentiality methods”. The cell key \\r\\nmethod  is  one  of  the  statistic  disclosure  control  (SDC) \\r\\nmethods. \\r\\nDove, Iain & Ntoumos, Christos & Spicer, Keith. [20] \\r\\nstated that a benefit of Cell-key perturbation over k-anonymity \\r\\nis that it can provide better privacy protection for individual \\r\\nvalues. This is because Cell-key perturbation adds noise to \\r\\neach value independently, which can make it harder for an \\r\\nattacker  to  infer  the  true  value.  In  contrast,  k-anonymity \\r\\ngeneralizes  the  data  within  groups,  which  can  lead  to \\r\\ninformation  loss  and  may  not  provide  as  strong  privacy \\r\\nprotection for individual values. \\r\\nB. Fraser and J. Wooton. [21] proposed a method for \\r\\nprotecting  confidential  information  in  tabular  output  by \\r\\nmaking it more difficult to use differencing attacks to identify \\r\\nsensitive information. \\r\\nCynthia  Dwork,  Frank  McSherry,  Kobbi  Nissim,  and \\r\\nAdam  Smith  [5]  proposed  a  new  mechanism  that  was \\r\\ndesigned  to  protect  privacy  called  Differential  privacy. \\r\\nDifferential privacy (DP) itself is not an algorithm, but a \\r\\nframework for data privacy. \\r\\nP. Cichonski, T. Millar, T. Grance, and K. Scarfone [6] \\r\\nstated  principles  for  handling  events  are  offered  in  the \\r\\nhandling for reviewing data and selecting the best course of \\r\\naction for each occurrence. \\r\\nJanos,  Feher  &  Nguyen,  Phuoc  Dai  [7] described all \\r\\nsecurity concerns for data center industry. The main tasks of \\r\\nthe SOC team are to detect incidents, investigate, and respond \\r\\nto each incident.  \\r\\nEmam, Khaled et, al [8] argued that most privacy laws \\r\\nallow healthcare institutes disclose medical records without \\r\\nconsent if all datasets are de-identified but they tend to fail by \\r\\nthe re-identification  attacks. \\r\\nThe 20th International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE2023)\\r\\n191Authorized licensed use limited to: Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember.

This \\r\\nevidence shows that only the removal of directly identify \\r\\nfields from a dataset is not enough to protect against data \\r\\nbreach risk.  \\r\\nBenitez, K., & Malin, B. [12] stated that the common three \\r\\nfields of date of birth, gender, and residential zip code can re-\\r\\nidentification  a personal medical record. \\r\\nNarayanan  and  Shmatikov  [11] demonstrated that \\r\\nattackers can easily re-identification  the subscriber’s personal \\r\\ndata  from  an  anonymized  Netflix  shared  dataset  that  is \\r\\ncombined with the IMDB dataset. \\r\\nY.  Ma  ,  Y.X.  Lin,  et  al.  [15] argued that  traditional \\r\\nmethods  of  data  protection,  such  as  data  masking  or \\r\\nencryption, are not sufficient for protecting aggregate business \\r\\ndata. \\r\\nKhordadpour and Peyman [10] demonstrated that the main \\r\\nbenefit of Cell-key perturbation in this paper is that it can help \\r\\nto reduce the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to \\r\\nsensitive data.  \\r\\nJames Bailie and Chien-Hung [13, 14] demonstrated that \\r\\nCell-key perturbation is a new kind of data privacy protection \\r\\nand give many advantages greater than Differential privacy \\r\\n(DP). \\r\\nKato  Mivule  demonstrated  [17]  in  his  paper  that  data \\r\\nperturbation utilizing noise addition is a suitable methodology \\r\\nfor published data sets. \\r\\nIII. METHODOLOGY \\r\\nAccording  to  GDPR  laws,  Personal  Identification \\r\\nInformation (PII) has to be stored secretly away from hackers; \\r\\ntherefore, they have to be decomposed from the original data. \\r\\nIn this process, the SOCs team has to decompose the original \\r\\ndata into two segments including the PII segment and the non-\\r\\nPII segment. For the non-PII segment, we need to add noise to \\r\\nmitigate  and re-Identification risk.  In  this  experiment,  the \\r\\nSOC team applied additive noise to the numerical attributes. \\r\\nThe following steps are the data preparation process. Firstly, \\r\\nPII has to be identified and then separated into a new secret \\r\\ntable. Secondly, Cell Key Perturbation Methodology [2] is \\r\\napplied to the non-PII segment to prevent re-Identification \\r\\nrisk.  \\r\\n \\r\\nFig. 3. Privacy data segmentation process \\r\\nA. Statistical Noise control technique \\r\\nThe Cell-key method is one of the Statistical Noise control \\r\\ntechniques to protect data privacy. The random record key to \\r\\nevery data record acts as an index of the cells of a pre-defined \\r\\nperturbation table.  \\r\\n In order to return the same answer on the same query, \\r\\nthe Cell-key method intend to assign permanently the record \\r\\nkey to each record. These row keys are used to generate \\r\\nconsistent values for the perturbation. Whenever the same \\r\\nquery, the same perturbation will be applied.  \\r\\nCell-key perturbation[13] is a technique used to protect \\r\\nsensitive data by adding random noise to the original data \\r\\nvalues. Perturbation of zeros is a specific type of cell-key \\r\\nperturbation where random noise is added to the cells of a \\r\\ndataset that contain zero values. The purpose of perturbing \\r\\nzero cells is to protect the privacy of individuals by preventing \\r\\nattackers from inferring any sensitive information from the \\r\\nabsence of data. \\r\\nBy using R-key indexes, the frequency of the group was \\r\\ncounted and summed into an integer number and then divided \\r\\nby modulo arithmetic to produce a cell-level key to determine \\r\\nthe perturbation.  \\r\\nA cell-level key in the lookup table is the value of the \\r\\nperturbation that will be applied to the cell, based on the \\r\\noriginal cell value and the cell-level key. the cell-level key as \\r\\na row axis, the cell values in the column is a perturbation value \\r\\nto add to microdata. \\r\\nAt this point, the method can determine the amount of \\r\\nnoise to add to the table cell. This method ensures that each \\r\\ncell receives the same perturbation in a repeated process. Zero \\r\\ncells stand for records that do not receive any perturbation. \\r\\nMost of the cells are not affected by perturbation in a large \\r\\ndataset.  \\r\\nAn advantage of Cell Key Perturbation is its consistent and \\r\\nrepeatable. The cell key and the cell count are input to look up \\r\\nin the perturbation table and then added to the cell value. The \\r\\nvalue obtained from looking up this perturbation table is a \\r\\nperturbed result. \\r\\nIV. DATA PREPARATION \\r\\nFigure 4 shows that the original data is separated into the \\r\\nde-Identified segment and the Non-PII data segment. The PII \\r\\nsegment is a table that contains all PII data such as social \\r\\nsecurity number, name, last name and etc. The non-PII data \\r\\nsegment  is  a  de-identified  dataset  that  removes  all  direct \\r\\nidentifiers and has a primary key such as SSN on both tables \\r\\nfor linkage. \\r\\nThe 20th International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE2023)\\r\\n192Authorized licensed use limited to: Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember.

EXPERIMENT \\r\\nPython is a language to demonstrate our methodology in \\r\\nthis study because of its flexibility and its ability to data \\r\\nmanipulation.  However,  it  is  not  suitable  for  commercial \\r\\nproducts and is not intended to be. This study is to demonstrate \\r\\nthe concept of cell-key perturbation. Commercial tools are \\r\\navailable such as an R-package and τ -argus. \\r\\nJupyter Notebook tool and python are implemented in this \\r\\nexperiment to demonstrate a key concept. Pandas is a built-in \\r\\npackage in the Jupyter Notebook. From de-identified data in \\r\\nsection IV, the panda's crosstab () function in Python is used \\r\\nto build a frequency table in a cross-tabulation table form. It \\r\\ncan show the frequency with which certain groups of data. A \\r\\nfamous adult dataset is chosen because it contains a lot of \\r\\nquasi-identifier attributes such as {age, sex, race}. The set of \\r\\nthree variables is a quasi-identifier because it is a minimal set. \\r\\nThe cell key perturbation method is as following steps: \\r\\nA. Step 1: Create a record key by assigning a random \\r\\nnumber between 0 and 99. \\r\\nThe R-key package in Figure 2 generates a row-key to use \\r\\nin a frequency table. The row key is added to a non-PII \\r\\nsegment. The  larger  the  random  number,  the  longer \\r\\ncomputation is. Only two digits between 0 and 99 is chosen as \\r\\na random number range. \\r\\n \\r\\nFig. 5. Excerpt from experiment script in Step 1 \\r\\nB. Step 2: Create a frequency table using the crosstab \\r\\nfunction. \\r\\nIn this step, a P-table is constructed, and the crosstab \\r\\nfunction is used to count the frequency of the cell values \\r\\ngroup.  \\r\\n \\r\\nFig. 6.

Step 5: Generate new anonymized dataset. \\r\\nThe final step is to construct an anonymized dataset that \\r\\nlies in front of a firewall. Unlike another method, this method \\r\\nintends  to  add  minimal  noise  to  the  original  dataset.  The \\r\\nadvantage of this method is most of the cells are not modified \\r\\ncalled “Zero cells”. The other word not all cells are modified.  \\r\\nThis  experiment  shows  an  output  from  the Jupyter \\r\\nNotebook. \\r\\n  \\r\\nFig. 9. Unperturbed and Perturbed table output \\r\\nFigures 9 (a) and 9 (b) show the output generated for all 3 \\r\\nvariables before and after perturbation respectively. Figure 9 \\r\\n(a) contains the unperturbed frequency counts before values \\r\\nfrom  the  P-table  are  applied.  Figure  9  (b)  contains  the \\r\\nperturbed  counts;  cells  with  noise  added  have  been \\r\\nhighlighted. Here is an explanation highlighted as follows in \\r\\nFigures 10. \\r\\nColor Summation \\r\\nyellow -3 \\r\\nred -2 \\r\\nLight coral -1 \\r\\nwhite 0 \\r\\nLight blue +1 \\r\\nGreen +2 \\r\\nlight green +3 \\r\\nFig. 10. Color highlighting table \\r\\nSince cell key values are modulo with 4, the range of \\r\\nsummation is between -3 and 3 in step 3. Most of the cells are \\r\\napplied all perturbation to cells randomly in step 4.  \\r\\nThe re-Identification of the record corresponding to the \\r\\ncell with value 1 may take place based on any combination of \\r\\nage=17, male, and Eskimo shown in Figure 9 (b) ;However, \\r\\nattackers are not sure if the dataset is real values or perturbated \\r\\nvalues. \\r\\nVI. FUTURE WORK. \\r\\nThe perturbation of zeros is a specific type of Cell-key \\r\\nperturbation  used  in  data  privacy  and  security  to  protect \\r\\nsensitive information.  \\r\\nIf we perturb all rows, it damages data utility. Data privacy \\r\\ntries to preserve some risk groups. In our case, f=1. The effect \\r\\nof using the perturbation of zeros is that it adds random noise \\r\\nto  the  cells  of  a  dataset  that  contain  zero  values.  The \\r\\nperturbation of zeros is however out of scope in this paper. We \\r\\nwill cope with these issues in our future work. \\r\\nCell-key perturbation is a technique that is widely used in \\r\\nEurope. Comparing performance with an existing algorithm is \\r\\ndifficult because Cell-key perturbation is an alternative way to \\r\\nhandle the differencing attacks. Therefore, we hope to make a \\r\\nperformance comparison in future work. \\r\\nVII. CONCLUSION \\r\\nCell-key  perturbation data  privacy  procedure  for  the \\r\\nSecurity  Operations  Center  Team  is  explained  and \\r\\nimplemented in this paper. In Figure 4, attackers cannot be so \\r\\nsure  whether  the  information in  the  table  are  affected by \\r\\nperturbation or its original values. Some of cells are added \\r\\nwith noise. perturbation tables (p-tables) are a goal of the Cell-\\r\\nkey  method. Jupyter  Notebook tool  and Python are \\r\\nimplemented to compute perturbation tables.  \\r\\nThe anonymizer server in Figure 2 was designed to allow \\r\\nusers to do queries online. Consistency is so important for \\r\\nonline service. The same user will get the same anonymized \\r\\ndataset  all  the  time;  therefore,  the Cell-key  perturbation \\r\\nmethod is a suitable answer for E-Commerce service. The \\r\\nserver performs data preparation in section 4 and then runs \\r\\nCell Key Perturbation in section 5. \\r\\nREFERENCES \\r\\n[1] D. Shahjee, N.

Setting up or operating a SOC is an expensive venture and\\r\\nbusinesses continually evaluate their return on security investment and how\\r\\nto improve overall performance [5]. Unfortunately, when it comes to assessing\\r\\nthe performance of SOCs, the industry generally rely on statistical data gener-\\r\\nated from deployed technological solutions such asfirewalls, Intrusion\\r\\nDetection Systems (IDSs’) and vulnerability scanners to determine or assess\\r\\nefficiencies [7]. The problem with this approach is that it fails to take into\\r\\nconsideration human factors (the human security analysts or people). People\\r\\n(SOC analysts) are key to maintaining deployed security controls, the investiga-\\r\\ntion of threats and incident management of all suspicious activities [8].\\r\\nAdditionally, SOCs rely on a human to outsmart a malicious attacker [1]. It is\\r\\nthe SOC analyst that decides what is suspicious and what is not, and their\\r\\nperformance determines what happens when cyber-criminals strike [1]. It is\\r\\ntherefore vital to understand the challenges that analysts face and its impacts\\r\\non their performance in a SOC. In addition, it is essential to understand how the\\r\\n126E.

[10], stress that analysts performance is a pertinent issue in\\r\\ncybersecurity as they play a crucial role in operating and maintaining the tools\\r\\nused by businesses to detect and respond to cyber threats. Analysts are\\r\\nexpected to monitor, detect, analyze and report cyber threat [6]. Also, analysts\\r\\nare supposed to have a greater cyber situational awareness and the necessary\\r\\nskills to detect attacks [4]. These responsibilities and tasks make it essential for\\r\\nanalysts to maintain a high standard of operational effectiveness and perfor-\\r\\nmance as a poor operational performance will hinder the overall efficiency of\\r\\na SOC [7]. One would expect analysts to receive various forms of support and\\r\\nongoing training to realize their objectives in the SOC.\\r\\nHowever, defending against cyber-attacks is not a trivial task and analysts face\\r\\nnumerous challenges, many of which affect their performance. For example, [8]\\r\\npoint out the complexity and intensity of the work of analysts. Similarly, the\\r\\nvolume of alerts/security events presented to the analysts, along with the multi-\\r\\nfaceted nature of cyber attacks all presents an enormous challenge to the analysts\\r\\n[4,11]. There are also issues and challenges arising from human factors such as\\r\\nstress level of the analysts, vigilance, mental workload, fatigue along with organi-\\r\\nsational processes and technological factors that impact on analysts performance\\r\\n[4,12]. While these may just be instances of what may well be part of a bigger\\r\\nproblem, and in some cases leading to analysts burnout [7,13,14], it remains\\r\\nunclear whether researchers and practitioners have a comprehensive insight into\\r\\nchallenges faced by analysts from human, organisational and technological\\r\\nperspective.\\r\\nEffort to understand the challenges faced by analysts are scattered across\\r\\nliterature, disjointed and often do not provide a comprehensive view of the\\r\\nissue. Hámornik and Krasznay [15], state that SOCs face internal and external\\r\\nissues. According to Lif and Sommestad [4], extant literature contains a few pieces\\r\\nof information on the challenges faced by analysts. Different authors mention\\r\\ndifferent problemsfaced by analysts. Forexample,Sundaramurthyetal.[7],report\\r\\nalert fatigue and workload as a factor that leads to analyst burnout but acknowl-\\r\\nedges that their model does not provide exhaustive coverage of multiple chal-\\r\\nlenges faced by analysts. Other researchers such as Lif and Sommestad [4],\\r\\nidentified human factors such as multitasking, situation awareness, automation,\\r\\nmental workload and utilises Wickens’model of information processing to show\\r\\nthe interplay between these factors. There are also concerns about tacit knowl-\\r\\nedge and skills shortage within the industry. A comprehensive list and analysis of\\r\\nthese challenges can be used as the basis to improve and adapt SOC services.\\r\\nWhen it comes to assessing the performance of analysts, the literature reports\\r\\na lack of adequate measures and metrics [5,7,16]. In fact, Sundaramurthy and his\\r\\ncolleagues highlight the need to improve existing metrics for analysts [5].

We define a measure as a concrete, quantifiable\\r\\nand objective attribute such as the number of incidents raised by analysts and\\r\\na metric as an abstract, somewhat subjective attribute that can have many\\r\\nmeasures, for example, monitoring function metrics. In other words, measures\\r\\nsupport metrics [18]. The word performance in this context, as defined by the\\r\\nOxford English Dictionary, refers to the action or process of performing a task or\\r\\nfunction.\\r\\nEven though researchers have proposed various metrics for assessing the\\r\\neffectiveness and efficiency of a SOC, these assessment methods do not always\\r\\ntake analysts effort and performance into consideration. For example, Jacobs\\r\\net al. [2], presents a metric for evaluating the performance of a SOC based on the\\r\\ncapability services provided and maturity levels, but do not discuss assessment\\r\\nmethod (measures or metrics) for the analysts performance. Similarly, Schinagl,\\r\\nSchoon and Paans [1], also propose a performance metric for SOCs, but their\\r\\nwork does not adequately present a formal quantitative method for measuring\\r\\nthe efforts of analysts. Some scholars, however, have identified a number of\\r\\nways by which analysts efforts can be evaluated. These writers, however, often\\r\\ndo not differentiate between metrics and measures. In most cases, the terms\\r\\nmeasures and metrics are blurred and used interchangeably by the writers [5–7].\\r\\nFor example, some authors suggest the number of incidents raised or closed\\r\\nper day as a metric for the analysts [6]. Others focus on the time taken by an\\r\\nanalyst to detect an incident [5,7]. Based on our definition, these are measures\\r\\nrather than metrics. Moreover, analysts tasks are not limited to incidents raised\\r\\nor closed. The evidence from the literature also suggests that analysts are not\\r\\nsatisfied with this kind of measures as it does not take into consideration several\\r\\naspects of their work [7]. A much more worrying concern that literature posits is\\r\\nthat SOC Managers also lament about the lack of good metrics for assessing\\r\\nanalysts [7].\\r\\nDespite the important role played by analysts, research continues to focus\\r\\nexclusively on building blocks for SOC, SOC framework and SOC technologies [1].\\r\\nIn fact, the literature is replete with research on the various aspects of SOC opera-\\r\\ntions but not much on holistic approaches to measuring the efforts of analysts. It is\\r\\nwith this premise that this study aims to identify the challenges faced by analysts\\r\\nand metrics for assessing the performance of analysts as they address these\\r\\nchallenges. To date, there is no single study that presents a detailed overview of\\r\\nthe state of the art on the challenges faced by analysts or how analysts’perfor-\\r\\nmance is measured as they address/respond to the challenges they face. The\\r\\npresent lack of such review makes this paper an important and a timely one.\\r\\nOur contribution is to gather, analyze and synthesize existing knowledge and\\r\\nprovide an overview of all that is known about challenges faced by SOC analysts,\\r\\nand metrics for measuring the performance of a SOC analyst addressing the\\r\\nchallenges they face. Additionally, we also map challenges faced by analysts\\r\\nwith existing performance metrics. We hope that ourfindings will be useful to\\r\\n128E.

We then applied\\r\\na quality assessments criterion to all the papers included in ourfinal list. Our\\r\\nquality assessment approach is detailed below.\\r\\nOur quality assessment process focuses on the methodology used by the\\r\\nselected papers and is based on checklist/instrument presented by Critical\\r\\nAppraisal Skills Programme (CASP) [30] and suggestions provided by Dybå\\r\\nand Dingsøyr in [25]. Although there is no standardised quality assessment\\r\\ntool, Dybå and Dingsøyr along with CASP provide some vital quality assessment\\r\\nchecklist which has been used by various researchers conducting systematic\\r\\nreviews in severalfields [27]. Our checklist, which is adapted from the work of\\r\\nDybå and Dingsøyr [25], is made up of 12 items as shown inTable 2. However,\\r\\nonly one criterion was used as the basis for including or excluding a paper. This\\r\\napproach is similar to the strategy used by Dybå and Dingsøyr [25].\\r\\nNotwithstanding, some scholars argue that a checklist cannot be used to assess\\r\\nquality [20]. However, from our perspective, using a single criterion allowed us\\r\\nto access a sufficient number of literature until saturation points where an\\r\\nadditional study will not provide any new information [31].\\r\\nWe initiallyassessed the quality ofeach paper by answering the questions from\\r\\nthe checklist and assigning scores based on a three-point scale of Yes (Y) = 1, No\\r\\nor Not Reported (N) = 0 and Partially (P) = 0.5 to calculate each paper’s quality\\r\\nindex. Given that there are 12 items on our Quality Assessment Checklist (QAC)\\r\\nshown inTable 3, each paper could obtain a score between 0 and 12. We used the\\r\\nfirst quartile (12points/4 = 3points) as a cut-offpoint for included studies. While\\r\\nsome researchers favour this approach when assessing the quality of a paper in\\r\\na systematic review [27,32] we decided to drop this technique as SOCs are still\\r\\nevolving and relatively new in comparison to otherfields; hence applying\\r\\na stringent check could result in some papers that may make valuable contribu-\\r\\ntion scoring below the 3 point cut-off. We therefore decided to follow the\\r\\nsuggestions offered by Dybå and Dingsøyr [25], described earlier.\\r\\nAppendix A(Table A1)showsthedataextractionforms.Theinformationcol-\\r\\nlected on each paper includes the author/s names, date of publication, method of\\r\\ninvestigation and data collection method.

A large\\r\\nvolume of alerts means analysts often struggle tofind true attacks among\\r\\nthe mist of many alerts. Onwubiko [6], points out that not all alerts lead to\\r\\nan incident as there are false incidents (false positives). Incidents are\\r\\nevents or alerts that pose a threat [36]. Limiting log collection to impor-\\r\\ntant assets/devices, policy tuning andfiltering out unnecessary alerts\\r\\n(noise) have been suggested by some writers/researchers as some of\\r\\nthe techniques that can be used to address these challenges [6].\\r\\nDespite these recommendations, the evidence from the literature sug-\\r\\ngests that analysts continue to struggle when it comes to the volume of\\r\\nalerts they process [37].\\r\\n●False Positives (FPs)–FPs are reported by several authors as one of the\\r\\nmany challenges’analysts have to deal with (P1, P5, P6, P8, P10, P11 and\\r\\nP13). FP represents the number of‘false alarms’presented to the analysts\\r\\n[3,44]. These alarms are not true attacks (true positives) but are falsely\\r\\npresented to the analyst as though they are, causing them to initiate some\\r\\nform of investigation thereby wasting analyst time. 47% of the selected\\r\\npapers discuss the challenge posed by FPs and highlight that FPs contri-\\r\\nbute to the high number of alerts presented to the analysts. Like the\\r\\nvolume of alerts, FP’s are also the result of collecting too many logs. Lif\\r\\nand Sommestad [4], warn that too many FPs can result in an IDS operator\\r\\ncompletely ignoring alerts. Factors such as misconfiguration of systems\\r\\nand weak signature/detection strings designed by the vendor or the ana-\\r\\nlysts that incorrectly matches legitimate network traffic. Recommendation\\r\\nfor reducing FP include tuning policies and machine learning [38].\\r\\nBusinesses can also put in more efforts into addressing misconfiguration\\r\\nissues to reduce the burden on analysts. Tuning of policies and excluding\\r\\nfalse positive forms part of the work of an analyst [6].\\r\\n●False  Negatives (FNs)–FNs are also reported by 33% of the selected\\r\\npapers. P6, P8, P10, P11 and P13 all identify false negative as one of the\\r\\nchallenges faced by the analyst. FN’s are generally the result of a detections\\r\\nsystem inability to identify true security events posing a challenge for the\\r\\nanalysts [39,3]. Analysts have to rely on other signs on the network, for\\r\\nexample, using behavioural analytical technique to identify malicious\\r\\nactivity.\\r\\n●Sophisticated Attacks–(P3, P4, P6, P8, P12, P13, P14 and P15) report\\r\\nsophisticated attacks as another challenge for analysts. Modern-day attacks\\r\\ncan be hard to detect, especially given the complexity and stealthy meth-\\r\\nods used. Zhong et al. [3], suggest that the complexity pose challenges to\\r\\nanalysts ability to spot them among complex and large data sets. Analysts\\r\\nhave to rely on experience to thwart attacks when the attacker evades\\r\\nexisting technical controls [40].\\r\\n136E.

Along with this,\\r\\nanalysts are also under time pressure during incident handling [15].\\r\\nIdentifying an attack is one thing; handling the attack through the incident\\r\\nhandling process is another [36]. Both P4 and P10 suggest that detecting\\r\\nand managing security incidents (attack) is crucial for the success of a SOC.\\r\\nIncident management typically involves engaging with (or escalations to)\\r\\nother teams, internal or external to the organisation, to ensure that the\\r\\nimpact of any attack is minimised or removed [41]. The complexity of\\r\\nincident handling can be daunting for less experienced analysts which\\r\\nmeans they rely on the guidance of experienced analysts. With studies\\r\\nsuggesting SOCs struggling to retain experienced analysts, handling com-\\r\\nplex incidents becomes a challenge [10].\\r\\n●Skills/Experience Shortage–(P3, P4, P5, P12 and P15) highlight skills and\\r\\nexperience shortages are among the challenges facing the analysts. The\\r\\nrapid turnover of analysts means SOCs struggle to retain their most experi-\\r\\nenced and qualified analysts [1]. This creates a challenge for less experi-\\r\\nenced analysts as the opportunity to learn from experienced analysts\\r\\nbecomes an issue. The dynamic nature of cyber threats means that unless\\r\\nanalysts receive periodic training, either in-house or off-site paid training,\\r\\nthey are unlikely to possess that skills required to beat offan attacker [7].\\r\\n●Inadequate  Communication  between  Teams–P1 reports inadequate\\r\\ncommunicate between analysts as one of the challenges in SOCs [5].\\r\\nHámornik & Krasznay [15],explains that communication and information\\r\\nsharing is vital to the success of a SOC although they argue that team\\r\\nmembers generally do not have time to communicate when they are under\\r\\npressure. The lack of effective communication between the team impact on\\r\\nthe team’s performance [15]. Sundaramurthy et al. [7], state that SOCs must\\r\\nwork towards addressing the lack of communication so that analysts do not\\r\\nfeel left behind or isolated.\\r\\n●Tacit  Knowledge–The problem with tacit knowledge is that it is not\\r\\nlimited to SOC environment as many professions also have a similar issue\\r\\n[42]. However, within a SOC environment, P2 and P11 highlight that tacit\\r\\nknowledge can hinder or slow down the investigation in the SOC. Equally,\\r\\nP7 explains that one of the issues with tacit knowledge is that, experienced\\r\\nanalysts are unable to clearly explain reasons behind their actions for less\\r\\nexperienced analysts to learn. One approach to addressing this may be for\\r\\nSOCs to have playbooks or run books along with well-documented pro-\\r\\ncesses that less experienced can draw on to aid decision making in SOCs.\\r\\nFurther research into analysts decision-making process is required.\\r\\n●Manual and Repetitive Processes–(P1, P2, P4, P5, P6, P7, P9 and P15)\\r\\nidentified manual, repetitive and mundane step by step processes used by\\r\\nJOURNAL OF CYBER SECURITY TECHNOLOGY137\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"gch/hCiaRUZazM9prKhgKqHcrXyqGllgGWhwYSfBMrA=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf_15":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf_15\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":15,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nsome SOCs as causing dissatisfaction among the SOC analysts [7,5,44].\\r\\nFollowing rigid processes can also hinder analysts creativity in the SOC [7].\\r\\nOther problems with manual processes and analysis is that, they are highly\\r\\ninadequate for an enterprise organisation and businesses need to gear\\r\\nefforts towards automation [6,7]. The use of SIEM (Security Information and\\r\\nEvent Management) technologies along with security event visualisation\\r\\nsystems can ease offsome of the burden associated with manual and\\r\\nrepetitive processes [1,2].\\r\\n●Workloads–Sundaramurthy and his colleagues [43],argue that analysts\\r\\nare confronted with more alerts than they can investigate. This view is\\r\\nsupported by Feng et al. [38], who suggest that increased workload is\\r\\nmainly due to the overwhelming number of alerts analysts have to process.\\r\\nP3, P6, P7, P10, P9, P13, P14 and P15 all identify workload as a major\\r\\nchallenge faced by analysts.

Lif and Sommestad [4],posit that workload\\r\\nimpacts on analysts monitoring, analysis and response capabilities.

Ten of the selected papers (P1, P2, P5, P6, P7, P9,\\r\\nP11, P12, P13, P14) identify and reports on various metrics that are frequently\\r\\nused to measure analysts performance.\\r\\nAs pointed out earlier, authors do not always make the distinction between\\r\\nmetrics and measures and use the terms interchangeably. To that end, we\\r\\ngrouped existing assessment methods into quantitative and qualitative metrics/\\r\\nmeasures. The quantitative metrics/measures are less open to interpretation and\\r\\nprovide concrete measures, unlike the qualitative metricsthat usesnon-numerical\\r\\nand interpretive approach. The quantitative metrics identified are:\\r\\n●Time to Detect an Incident (TTD) or Average Time to Detect (ATTD)–\\r\\nThis metric focuses on the delta (time) between an issue occurring and the\\r\\nanalyst noticing it as identified in P1 and P11. It takes into consideration the\\r\\ntime an alert is detected by a detection tool, such as an Intrusion Detection\\r\\nSystem (IDS) or a SIEM, and the time that the analyst discovers it.\\r\\n●Average  Time  Taken  to  Respond  (ATTR)–ATTR focuses on the time\\r\\ntaken by an analyst to respond to an incident as reported in P12 and P14.\\r\\nUnlike ATTD, ATTR assesses response time rather than detection time.\\r\\nResponding may entail specific action such as reconfiguring a network to\\r\\nstop any threat. Some authors refer to this as the Average Total Time for\\r\\nAlert (avgTTA) Investigation [47]. Others refer to this as the time taken to\\r\\ninvestigate a customer under attack [39]. The time-based metrics focus on\\r\\nanalysts reaction times, in terms of how quick they respond or detect an\\r\\nincident.\\r\\n●Number of Alerts Analysed/Unanalysed by an analyst at the end of\\r\\na shift–This measure, focuses on counting the number of alerts processed\\r\\nby the analysts as identified in P6 and P14. These metrics do not take into\\r\\nconsideration the complexity of the alert [43].\\r\\n●The number of tickets closed per day–This metric merely counts the\\r\\nnumber of tickets closed by the analyst at the end of the day (P7, P9). These\\r\\nare incidents that have been resolved with no further actions required and\\r\\nhave therefore been closed by the analyst. This metric can be adjusted and\\r\\ntaken at the end of the week or even at the end of the month to show the\\r\\nperformance of an analyst as suggested by Onwubiko [6].\\r\\n●The number of incidents detected within a specific timeframe–This\\r\\nmetric attempt to capture the number of real events identified by the\\r\\nanalyst over a certain period as reported in P5. Closely associated with\\r\\nthe number of incidents detected, is a metric that counts the number of\\r\\nJOURNAL OF CYBER SECURITY TECHNOLOGY139\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"cyt7EM/TW2wfSLXRLZU/0MmurBOk/ELkuH5w9gPGrAM=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf_17":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf_17\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":17,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nfalse positives, number of false negatives, true positives and true negatives.\\r\\nOnwubiko [6],suggest that metrics such as the number of false positives,\\r\\nnumber of false negatives, true positives and true negatives as a useful\\r\\nmetrics that can be used by SOC managers to measure the performance of\\r\\nanalysts.

Analysts are measured on time it takes to complete these\\r\\ntasks [5]. This kind of metrics are dependent on the functions expected of\\r\\nanalysts and may well vary from one SOC to another. We argue that the\\r\\ndifferent functions and tasks expected from analysts could be one of the\\r\\nreasons why researchersfind it difficult to devise an objective metric.\\r\\n●Time spent on each ticket–Some authors associate this with the time it\\r\\ntakes the analyst to create tickets (P1). Naturally, some tickets take longer\\r\\nthan others, depending on the nature and complexity of the incident\\r\\ninvolved [5]. Research suggests that analysts despise these kinds of time-\\r\\nbased metrics [7], however, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently\\r\\nno study that investigates how to improve existing measures from the\\r\\nviewpoint of an analyst.\\r\\nWhereas the above metrics focus on quantitative measures, there are other analyst\\r\\nperformance metrics based on qualitative (subjective) measures. Nevertheless, both\\r\\ncategories of metrics provide an empirical measure as they are based on observa-\\r\\ntions and experiences of analyst [46]. Qualitative metrics identified are:\\r\\n●A measure of the competency and experience of the analyst–Some\\r\\nSOC researchers uses questionnaires or simulated exercises to assess the\\r\\nexperience and competency of analysts. For example, Schinagl, Schoon\\r\\nand Paans [1],in P4 used a questionnaire to gather information on the\\r\\nreported experiences of analysts as part of evaluating the overall effective-\\r\\nness of a SOC [1]. Others writers such as McClain et al. [10],employ cyber\\r\\ntraining exercises to assess the competencies of analysts based on the\\r\\noutcome of their performance.\\r\\n●The Use of Success Stories–The need to justify the value of SOCs and\\r\\nanalyst’s performance has led to some SOCs using‘success stories’as\\r\\nreported by P7. P1 explain that success stories are used to demonstrate\\r\\nthe achievement/s of analysts and the impact of implementing a specific\\r\\ntechnical solution.

However, Zhong et al. [47,44] argue that the\\r\\nvolume of alerts impedes on analysts ability to generate a high-quality\\r\\nincident report. Notwithstanding, for such a measure to be effective, the\\r\\nuseful pieces of information analysts need to collect must to be commu-\\r\\nnicated to analysts and should be standardised across the team.\\r\\n●Quality of Analysis–Shah et al. [3],suggest that in addition to the need to\\r\\nidentify threats promptly, analysts also need to undertake quality analysis.\\r\\nWhile this may be an accurate statement, the problem with this kind of\\r\\nmeasurement is that the term‘quality’is subjective and makes it difficult to\\r\\ndefine such a metric [45].\\r\\nMapping metrics and challenges\\r\\nThe purpose of RQ3 was to examine the mapping between the challenges faced by\\r\\nanalysts and metrics for measuring analysts performance. Hart [20],state that map-\\r\\nping denotes the linkage between ideas, data and concepts from existing literature.\\r\\nWith this in mind, we sought to investigate the relationship between analysts\\r\\nperformance metrics and the challengesthey face. A conclusion drawn from the\\r\\npapers reviewed was that some authors mention analysts performance metrics; but\\r\\ndo not discuss how these metrics capture’sanalystsefforts (performance) as they\\r\\naddress some of the challenging aspects of their work [1,6].

We believe\\r\\nthis is a clear research gap that future work can address.\\r\\nWe noted that, although there are metrics for assessing the performance of\\r\\nanalysts as they tackle some of the challenging aspects of their work; existing\\r\\nmetrics are disjointed as they tend to focus on different challenges or analysts’\\r\\ntasks and does not give a holistic picture [6]. Thisfinding, in a way, confirms the\\r\\nconcerns raised by analysts in the anthropological study of SOCs conducted by\\r\\nSundaramurthy et al.

Indeed, all the metrics showed inFigure 4can\\r\\nbe used to evaluate how well the analysts are performing, albeit they are dis-\\r\\njointed and unless a SOC implements multiple metrics, it will be hard to get\\r\\na holistic view of analysts’effort. Notwithstanding, measuring human factors such\\r\\nas analystssituational awareness,vigilanceand attentionare also important to get\\r\\na holistic view of analysts performance [4].\\r\\nDiscussion\\r\\nAlthough SOCs have been an active research area, the challenges faced by\\r\\nanalysts and performance metrics for analysts are usually mentioned by\\r\\nresearchers in passing and are rarely the main focus. This is discouraging\\r\\nbecause challenges faced by analysts impacts on the performance of the SOC\\r\\n[44]. Identification of specific challenges faced by analysts will provide SOC\\r\\nexperts with an opportunity to learn and facilitate the development of novel\\r\\napproaches to helping analysts address these challenges. Likewise, measuring\\r\\nthe performance of an analyst is important because anything that is not mea-\\r\\nsured cannot be managed [9]. From a practical perspective, an objective per-\\r\\nformance metric can be used by the analyst for self-assessment to establish how\\r\\nwell they are contributing to the team’s objective. SOC managers can also use\\r\\nobjective performance metrics to evaluate analysts’performance and to moti-\\r\\nvate them [7].\\r\\nMany of the challenges faced by the analyst pointed out in the papers\\r\\nreviewed, play into the hands of an attacker. For example, over 40% of the\\r\\npapers reviewed reported the volume of alerts received by an analyst as\\r\\na critical issue. Although collecting system events logs can provide valuable\\r\\ninformation about an attacker’s activities, in practice large volume of alerts also\\r\\nmeans that the analysts have to go through thousands of alerts to detect\\r\\na single true attack if any [7]. Attackers can easily blend in among the mist of\\r\\nseveral logs. Recommendations such as collecting essential logs, designing\\r\\nuseful use cases (UC’s) and using pre-defined correlation rules in SIEM solutions,\\r\\ndo not seem to address this challenge [50,44]. While it is acknowledged that\\r\\nanalysts cannot possibly investigate all alerts and that some level of automation\\r\\nis required, tuning policies can help analysts to manage alert volumes.\\r\\nInterestingly, to the best of our knowledge, analysts coping strategies when it\\r\\ncomes to managing a large volume of alerts have not been studied or addressed\\r\\nbefore in literature.\\r\\nWe observed that FPs wastes analysts time and has an impact on the overall\\r\\nperformance of the SOC [51]. 47% of the selected papers identify FPs as a major\\r\\nchallenge facing analysts.

However,\\r\\npolicy tuning andfiltering to reduce FPs is a time-consuming activity [15].\\r\\nNotwithstanding, unless analysts are measured on the number of FP tickets\\r\\nraised, managers will not know those that need training. Future metrics, there-\\r\\nfore, must take this into consideration.\\r\\nAnother area of concern is analyst burnout, which research shows lead to\\r\\nhigh analyst turnover. According to Sundaramurthy et al. [7,12], negative factors\\r\\nsuch as low skills, the lack of empowerment, low growth and low creativity in\\r\\nSOCs lead to analyst burnout. They propose a model to explain the burned-out\\r\\nphenomena among analysts. However, the completeness of the model was not\\r\\nadequately verified due to the lack of analysts to participate in the study.\\r\\nBesides, evidence from current literature shows that there are other challenges\\r\\nfaced by analysts that were not captured in their work. For example, dealing\\r\\nwith sophisticated attacks and false positives [52]. Notwithstanding, none of the\\r\\npapers reviewed provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced by\\r\\nthe analyst. We argue that further research is needed tofill this gap and to\\r\\nvalidate prior work. The paper at hand is a stepping stone towards this goal.\\r\\nWhen it comes to measuring analyst performance, our review suggests that\\r\\nvarious metrics exist for doing this; however, some authors argue about their\\r\\ncompleteness and objectivity and make a case for the need for further research in\\r\\nthis area [5]. There are many aspects of analysts work or challenges that are not\\r\\ntakeninto considerationtogivea holisticpicture of theirperformanceina SOC[7].\\r\\nWe noted that existing performance tends to focus on analysts reaction time, for\\r\\nexample, time to detect an incident [7,39,47,48] or the frequency at which\\r\\na particular analyst task is carried out; in numerical terms [5–7]. The frequency\\r\\nin this situation refers to how often the data is collected or reported [53].\\r\\nResponsibilities of analysts are well documented by various studies [1,6,54]. For\\r\\nexample, analysts are expected to create Use Cases (UC’s) to detect attacks or\\r\\nmodify UC’s, yet in the examined literature we did not come across an objective\\r\\nmetric that takes use case creation into consideration [6].\\r\\nSundaramurthy et al. [7],highlight the concerns amongst analysts with regard\\r\\nto some of the time-based metrics. For example, they claim that an analyst\\r\\nargues that a metric that measures performance based on the time taken to\\r\\nresolve an incident does not take into considerations other operational tasks.\\r\\nLikewise, some of the existing time-based measures are also theoretical concept\\r\\nand not practical in many SOCs. For example, in their work‘A methodology for\\r\\nensuring fair allocation of CSOC effort for alert investigation’, Shah et al. [39],\\r\\nassumed that a SOC would employ analysts with similar capabilities (expertise).\\r\\nWith this assumption in mind, they designed a time-based measure to compute\\r\\nanalyst hours per day on their tasks. However, in practice, it is not practical for\\r\\nany SOC to have analysts with the same capabilities [39]. SOCs, therefore,\\r\\nemploy analysts with varied skills and experience [5]. Also, skills shortage and\\r\\nthefinancial cost of hiring experienced analysts makes this unachievable.\\r\\n144E.

However, these metrics\\r\\nalso have their limitations. For instance, metrics that count the number of\\r\\nsecurity incidents raised or closed by an analyst do not take into consideration\\r\\nthe complexity or priority of the incident [43]. In fact, such a metric does not\\r\\nprovide enough information to differentiate two or more analysts raising the\\r\\nsame number of incidents, assuming one is raising critical incidents, and another\\r\\nis raising false positives or lower priority alerts. Sundaramurthy et al. [5],stress\\r\\nthat priority should be given to alerts that pose a direct threat. A metric that\\r\\nmerely counts the number of incidents raised by analysts as shown inFigure 4\\r\\nmay suggest that the analysts are on par. However, in reality, some analysts may\\r\\nchoose to raise or close a high quantity of easy tickets to look good on such\\r\\na metric [43]. Shah et al. [39],suggest that alerts processed by analysts are usually\\r\\nclassified as low, medium and high severity.

One hundred and twenty-one (121)\\r\\npapers were initially selected as part of our SLR process; however, only 15\\r\\nstudies were included, based on our review protocol and criteria.\\r\\nIn this study, we identified twelve (12) challenges faced by analysts and\\r\\nreport them as: the volume of alerts presented to the analyst; the number of\\r\\nfalse positive alerts; false negatives; sophisticated attacks; incident handling/\\r\\nincident management complexity; skills/experience shortage; inadequate com-\\r\\nmunication between teams; tacit knowledge; manual and repetitive processes;\\r\\nworkloads; analysts burnout and the lack of adequate metrics and measures for\\r\\nassessing the efforts of analysts. We also identified the following metrics and\\r\\nmeasures for assessing the performance of analysts: time to detect an incident/\\r\\naverage time to detect an incident, average time taken to respond to an\\r\\nincident, number of alerts analysed/unanalysed by an analyst at the end of\\r\\na shift, the number of tickets closed per day, the number of incidents detected\\r\\nwithin a specific timeframe, time spent on operations by the analyst, time spent\\r\\non each ticket, a measure of the competency and experience of the analysts,\\r\\nsuccess stories, the quality of incident reports and the quality of analysis.\\r\\nOurfindings suggest that there are several areas of an analyst’s work that can\\r\\nbe measured to give a comprehensive picture of the work of an analyst.

Such a metric will be useful for\\r\\nSOC managers who may want to measure burnout amongst analysts.\\r\\nThis paper consolidates and synthesizes existing knowledge on the chal-\\r\\nlenges faced by analysts along with existing metrics for measuring analysts\\r\\nperformance.

ABSTRACT\\r\\nIncident Response Planning (IRP1) is essential for effective\\r\\ncybersecurity  management,  requiring  detailed  documentation\\r\\n(orplaybooks)  to  guide  security  personnel  during  incidents.\\r\\nYet,  creating  comprehensive  IRPs  is  often  hindered  by  chal-\\r\\nlenges  such  as  complex  systems,  high  turnover  rates,  and\\r\\nlegacy technologies lacking documentation. This paper argues\\r\\nthat,  despite  these  obstacles,  the  development,  review,  and\\r\\nrefinement of IRPs can be significantly enhanced through the\\r\\nutilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.\\r\\nBy  leveraging  LLMs  for  tasks  such  as  drafting  initial  plans,\\r\\nsuggesting best practices, and identifying documentation gaps,\\r\\norganizations can overcome resource constraints and improve\\r\\ntheir  readiness  for  cybersecurity  incidents.  We  discuss  the\\r\\npotential  of  LLMs  to  streamline  IRP  processes,  while  also\\r\\nconsidering the limitations and the need for human oversight in\\r\\nensuring the accuracy and relevance of generated content.

INTRODUCTION\\r\\nIn an era where digital threats evolve with increasing sophis-\\r\\ntication, the need for robust (cybersecurity) Incident Response\\r\\nPlans  (IRPs)  and  appropriate  Standard  Operating  Procedures\\r\\n(SOPs) has never been more critical. Incident Response Plans\\r\\nare the broad outline of what an organization may need to do\\r\\nto recover from various failures such as a malware infestation.\\r\\nAn  SOP  is  a  guide  to  the  actual  steps  needed  to  achieve\\r\\ncertain  outcomes  for  the  given  organization  (e.g.,  secure  an\\r\\naccount,  isolate  equipment  from  the  network).  The  NIST\\r\\nContingency Planning Guide and the Computer Security Inci-\\r\\ndent Handling Guide [5] [1] provide foundational frameworks\\r\\nfor addressing cyber incidents, emphasizing the necessity for\\r\\nsecurity  teams  to  be  well-prepared  to  mitigate  and  recover\\r\\nfrom  attacks.  This  paper  recognizes  a  gap  in  the  current\\r\\nmethodologies  for  developing  IRPs  and  SOPs-specifically,\\r\\nthe  twin  challenges  of  continuously  updating  these  plans  to\\r\\naddress  novel  and  esoteric  attack  vectors  and  the  lack  of\\r\\ncomposability of IRPs & SOPs.\\r\\nResponding  effectively  to  cybersecurity  incidents  requires\\r\\nnot  only  a  deep  understanding  of  potential  threats  but  also\\r\\n1IRP is also the abbreviation for “incident response plan”.\\r\\ncreative and lateral thinking to anticipate and mitigate emerg-\\r\\ning  vulnerabilities.  Herein,  we  introduce  a  novel  approach\\r\\nleveraging LLMs to enhance the design and planning of IRPs\\r\\nand  SOPs.  By  incorporating  LLMs,  we  aim  to  harness  their\\r\\ncapability  for  generating  innovative  solutions  and  continuous\\r\\nevaluation of existing plans against potential cyber threats.\\r\\nOur contribution to the cybersecurity domain is in demon-\\r\\nstrating  how  LLMs  can  facilitate  the  identification  and  cre-\\r\\nation of necessary response plans and procedures. We employ\\r\\nthe “SMART” framework for defining meaningful constraints\\r\\nfrom which to work, and we illustrate the practical application\\r\\nof LLMs in cybersecurity planning, offering insights into their\\r\\npotential to significantly enhance organizational preparedness\\r\\nfor security incidents.\\r\\nIII.  INCIDENTRESPONSEPLANNING\\r\\nIn  this  section  we  will  discuss  common  steps  for  Inci-\\r\\ndent  Response  Planning  and  the  creation  of  SOPs  for  an\\r\\norganization.  We  will  describe  common  areas  of  failure  and\\r\\ndemonstrate how LLMs can be leveraged to reduce likelihood\\r\\nor  impact  of  those  failures  and  improve  the  overall  process.\\r\\nWe  also  call  attention  to  the  notion  that  SOP  creation  is\\r\\noften out of scope during IR Planning, specifically SOPs are\\r\\nusually created by engineers or Individual Contributors (ICs)\\r\\nand  IRPs  are  often  created  by  management  in  tandem  with\\r\\nlegal departments or other higher-level personnel. We address\\r\\nthis discontinuity and show how tight coupling of these tasks\\r\\nimproves both.\\r\\nA.  Traditional IRP\\r\\nWe  base  our  definition  of  a  traditional  IRP  largely  on\\r\\nthe  NIST  800-61  Rev.  2  [1]  with  addition  perspectives  from\\r\\nindustry experience of the authors.\\r\\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\\r\\noutlines a structured approach for creating an incident response\\r\\nplan in   [1]. The process is divided into four main phases:\\r\\n1)Preparation:Establish and maintain an incident response\\r\\ncapability.  This  includes  training  personnel,  creating  an\\r\\nincident response policy and plan, setting communication\\r\\nguidelines, and acquiring necessary tools and resources to\\r\\nimprove organizational readiness for handling cybersecu-\\r\\nrity incidents [1].\\r\\n2)Detection and Analysis:Focus  on  identifying  and  in-\\r\\nvestigating  suspected  incidents  through  the  analysis  of\\r\\nprecursors  and  indicators,  gathering  information  from\\r\\narXiv:2403.01271v1  [cs.CR]  2 Mar 2024\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"fGTARv5xgyaC9h6l5cjSLcSxNWoGgUrEV/pBFAE7+TQ=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf_2":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf_2\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nvarious  sources,  documenting  incidents,  and  prioritizing\\r\\nthem for response [1].\\r\\n3)Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:Implement\\r\\nstrategic  decisions  to  contain  the  incident  and  prevent\\r\\nfurther  damage,  followed  by  the  eradication  of  harmful\\r\\nelements from the system. The recovery process involves\\r\\nrestoring  systems  or  devices  to  their  normal  functions\\r\\nand  monitoring  to  ensure  the  incident  has  been  fully\\r\\nresolved [1].\\r\\n4)Post-Incident Activity:Conduct  a  post-incident  review\\r\\nto learn from the incident, prevent future occurrences, and\\r\\nimprove  the  organization’s  incident  response  capability.\\r\\nThis  phase  is  essential  for  turning  the  incident  into  a\\r\\nlearning  opportunity  to  enhance  future  responses  and\\r\\nstrengthen the security posture [1].\\r\\nThe NIST guidance (and many other frameworks) describe\\r\\nthe need to ensure a team is prepared to handle incidents and\\r\\ndescribes some example pieces of information and tools which\\r\\nmight  be  necessary.  For  example:  Contact  Information  for\\r\\nteam members both within and external of the company, War\\r\\nRoom  area  with  shared  knowledge  of  starting  and  operating\\r\\nit,  Encryption  software,  etc.  These  items  must  be  manually\\r\\ncollected, made available, and maintained over time - even in\\r\\nthe absence of their usage. Further, a long period of non-use\\r\\nwill likely lead tosoftware decay2.\\r\\nAfter the team’s tools, procedures, and training is in a state\\r\\nwith  which  everyone  agrees  that  they  has  achieved  the  level\\r\\nof  maturation  adequate  for  handling  “live”  incidents,  then\\r\\nphase  2  (Detection  and  Analysis)  can  be  undertaken.  In  this\\r\\nphase, the guidance describes building an environment which\\r\\nis,  firstly,  resilient  to  attacks  to  the  greatest  degree  possible.\\r\\nSecondly,  ensuring  detection  rules  are  in  place  across  the\\r\\nvarious  technologies  in  use  and,  if  at  all  possible,  ensuring\\r\\ncorrelative  analysis  is  possible  for  detecting  both  precursors\\r\\n(data  suggestion  an  attack  might  be  forthcoming)  and  actual\\r\\nindicators   (indications   that   an   attack   has   happened   or   is\\r\\ncurrently happening).\\r\\nWhen both detection is in place and the team is capable of\\r\\nhandling it, phase 3 (Containment, Eradication, and Recovery)\\r\\nwill  start.  This  is  the  phase  in  which  the  IRPs  are  executed\\r\\nupon,  SOPs  might  be  employed,  and  ultimately  the  incident\\r\\nresolved.  Within  any  framework,  there  is  a  significant  gray\\r\\narea at this point because few incidents are exactly alike and\\r\\nmany might include novel elements or combinations of attacks\\r\\nthat  are  unique  to  an  organization  due  to  their  specific  set\\r\\nof hardware, software, cloud, and human characteristics. Still,\\r\\nNIST does recommend that key classes of attack have specific\\r\\nIRPs  ready  to  go.  Examples  include:  Malware  Infestation,\\r\\nDenial of Service Attacks, and other.\\r\\nFinally,   after   the   incident   has   been   resolved   (phase   3\\r\\ncompleted), then the post-incident activities can be scheduled\\r\\nand  executed.  These  largely  involve  reviewing  the  incident,\\r\\n2Software  Decay  or  “bit  rot”  is  a  circumstance  under  which  software\\r\\nbecomes  buggy  or  unusable  over  time  through  changes  unrelated  to  thesoftware itself, such as OS updates.\\r\\nthe actions taken, determining which things could have gone\\r\\nbetter, and making adjustments.\\r\\nThere  are  some  common  challenges  with  this  approach\\r\\nunrelated to the approach itself. The devil is in the details or,\\r\\nmore correctly, in the maintenance of the plan. For example:\\r\\nif an IRP describes contacting Alice in the Legal department\\r\\nwhen an incident occurs and includes her contact information,\\r\\nthen this is only accurate so long as Alice is a) Still employed,\\r\\nb) Available, c) Still the correct and responsible party. If any\\r\\nof  the  conditions  in  that  conjunction  become  false,  then  the\\r\\nIRP instructions become worse-than-useless because they are\\r\\nnow misleading rather than just missing.\\r\\nAnother  example  might  be  that  the  company  has  switched\\r\\nfrom one cloud provider to another for some common service,\\r\\nsuch as Single Sign-On (SSO). In this scenario, a large scale\\r\\nengineering  project  might  have  been  undertaken  over  the\\r\\ncourse  of  months  and  the  SSO  environment  was  migrated.\\r\\nNow,  the  IRP  might  represent  language  associated  with  the\\r\\nprevious  service  which  would  mislead  incident  responders\\r\\nwho  are  new  to  the  team  or  who  had  not  been  aware  of  the\\r\\nmigration. It could also cause confusion when reading through\\r\\ndocumentation. Additionally, fidelity to the SOPs for specific\\r\\ntypes of actions might not have been written and consequently\\r\\nslow  down  the  procedures  (e.g.,  Instructions  on  resetting  the\\r\\nMFA on account are now wrong; a severely problematic issue\\r\\nwhen time is of the essence during an incident).\\r\\nIt is within this context, that human frailty and the protean\\r\\nnature of business objectives and prioritization, can cause IRPs\\r\\nand SOPs to become obsolete over the course of time, without\\r\\nthemselves having changed (similar to software-decay2).\\r\\nB.  LLM-Augmented IRP\\r\\nWe   now   juxtapose   a   new   contribution   to   IRP:   LLM-\\r\\nAugmented IRP. From Section III-A we appreciate that there\\r\\nare  many  challenges  to  producing  and  maintaining  IRPs  and\\r\\ntheir  associated  SOPs  which  may  not  reflect  negatively  on\\r\\nany  individual  contributor.  By  leveraging  LLMs  in  the  ways\\r\\nwe describe in this section, many of the common pitfalls can\\r\\nbe  overcome  and  a  stronger  IR  Planning  process,  and  SOP-\\r\\nbuilding process can be achieved.\\r\\n1)  IRPs and SOPs:IRPs and SOPs have a relationship with\\r\\neach  other  which,  while  described  in  the  NIST  guidelines,\\r\\nis  sometimes  underrepresented  in  industry.  NIST  describes\\r\\nSOPs this way:“Procedures should be based on the incident\\r\\nresponse   policy   and   plan.   Standard   operating   procedures\\r\\n(SOPs)  are  a  delineation  of  the  specific  technical  processes,\\r\\ntechniques, checklists, and forms used by the incident response\\r\\nteam.  [...]  following  standardized  responses  should  minimize\\r\\nerrors,  particularly  those  that  might  be  caused  by  stressful\\r\\nincident handling situations. SOPs should be tested to validate\\r\\ntheir  accuracy  and  usefulness,  then  distributed  to  all  team\\r\\nmembers”.\\r\\nNotably, SOPs are typically the purview of an individual or\\r\\nteam  which  is  responsible  for  a  specific  technology,  such  as\\r\\nthe  process  to  reset  an  MFA  token,  or  resetting  a  password.\\r\\nAn SOP’s relationship to an IRP can be visualized in Figure 1.\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"D228wgTUEIJ5sbU/rr1EI7MQ9s1HP7odbBH6GfeDIt0=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf_3":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf_3\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nIRP1\\r\\nSOP1SOP2SOP3\\r\\nFig. 1.   Simplistic IRP-SOP Relationship\\r\\nAn IRP is typically a larger-scale undertaking which includes\\r\\nmanagement and is often built with input from across depart-\\r\\nments.  The  disconnect  happens  in  the  area  where  high-level\\r\\nIRP directions (“disconnect the computer from the network”)\\r\\nmeet real-world application (“log into tool X with an account\\r\\nhaving  security-controller  rights,  find  the  device  in  question,\\r\\nright-click [...]”).\\r\\nIt  is  not  uncommon  for  companies  to  either  a)  not  have\\r\\nSOPs at all or b) for them to be out of date. In these scenarios,\\r\\nthere  is  an  implicit  trust  that  the  current  staff  will  be  able\\r\\nto  handle  whatever  challenges  come  their  way.  This  is  often\\r\\nthe  case,  but  in  situations  of  high-stress  such  as  an  incident\\r\\nresponse event, time is usually a factor and optimizing for the\\r\\ncorrect execution is critical. Indeed, hoping that an engineer or\\r\\nadministrator performs all the right actions correctly and skips\\r\\nno steps, while simultaneously satisfactorily documenting their\\r\\nactions could be construed as,  at best, unlikely and at worst,\\r\\nunreasonable.\\r\\nWhere  LLMs  can  assist  with  this  is  in  the  planning  and\\r\\nbuilding stages of defining the SOPs that might be needed for\\r\\na particular technology stack. By way of example, we provide\\r\\na  broad  request to  ChatGPT  4  and  receive  a response  that  is\\r\\nimmediately helpful seen in Figure 2.\\r\\nWe  see  that  based  on  very  little  context  in  the  request,  a\\r\\nset of 15 SOPs are recommended.

On Version Control\\r\\nAn  important  concept  for  building  an  Incident  Response\\r\\nPlan  and  supporting  Standard  Operating  Procedures  is  that\\r\\nthey do not exist in a vacuum. The environment will inevitably\\r\\nchange  around  these  documents  and  in  so  doing,  they  will\\r\\nbecome stale. To this end, and especially when augmented by\\r\\nan LLM, Semantic Versioning [4] may be employed. Semantic\\r\\nVersioning is a versioning technique that makes clear the types\\r\\nof changes made to software, or in this case, documentation.\\r\\nIn brief, a Semantic Version comes in three parts split by a\\r\\nperiod: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. The semantics are such that\\r\\nif  the  MAJOR  part  is  incremented,  then  a  breaking  change\\r\\nhas been introduced. If the MINOR or PATCH parts have been\\r\\nincremented, then a non-breaking change has been introduced.\\r\\nThis  is  valuable  in  documentation  such  as  IRPs  and  SOPs\\r\\nbecause as an environment changes (e.g., new regulations are\\r\\npassed, new software is introduced or deprecated, new security\\r\\ncontrols  are  added,  etc.),  the  documentation  can  reflect  this.\\r\\nTaking  an  SOP  as  an  example,  we  consider  an  SOP  titled\\r\\n“SOP:  Reset  MFA  Token  (1.0.0)”.

USINGLLMS TOBUILD ANIRP\\r\\nIn this section we will describe patterns to use an LLM to\\r\\nbuild  an  IRP  and  describe  the  SOPs  which  will  be  needed\\r\\nto  support  it.  To  achieve  these  outcomes,  we’ve  adopt  the\\r\\n“SMART”  methodology  [2]  for  setting  and  measuring  the\\r\\ngoal.  The  smart  methodology  ensures  our  goal  isSpecific,\\r\\nMeasurable,Achievable,Relevant, andTime-bound. We will\\r\\ndemonstrate that these characteristics are reasonable for build-\\r\\ning IRPs and SOPs with assistance from an LLM.\\r\\nA.  Specific Goals\\r\\nWhen  utilizing  an  LLM  to  assist  with  the  construction\\r\\nof  IRPs  and  SOPs,  it  is  crucial  to  establish  specific  goals.\\r\\nThis  entails  defining  tasks  in  terms  that  are  concrete  and\\r\\nunambiguous. In instances where ambiguity exists, leveraging\\r\\nthe LLM for clarification can be invaluable. The precision of\\r\\nthe goal not only minimizes the likelihood of receiving noise\\r\\nor  overly  broad  responses  from  the  LLM  but  also  ensures\\r\\nthe  system  is  appropriately  bounded  to  focus  on  the  specific\\r\\nproblem at hand.\\r\\nThe  security  domain  presents  unique  challenges  in  setting\\r\\nspecific  goals  due  to  its  broad  cross-section  of  technology,\\r\\nrisks,  and  compliance  requirements.  Nonetheless,  by  ade-\\r\\nquately setting the context for the LLM, it becomes feasible to\\r\\nstart with a narrow focus, allowing the LLM to draw upon its\\r\\nextensive  training  data  to  provide  relevant  insights.  Some  of\\r\\nthese insights may be directly actionable, while others might\\r\\nbe  disregarded  based  on  their  applicability  to  the  specific\\r\\ncontext.\\r\\n1)  Effective Context Setting:\\r\\n•Contextualizing  Prompts:To  achieve  more  targeted  out-puts from LLMs, it is essential to contextualize prompts\\r\\neffectively. This could involve specifying the technolog-\\r\\nical  environment  (e.g.,  cloud-based  infrastructure,  on-\\r\\npremises  data  centers),  detailing  compliance  standards\\r\\n(e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), or outlining known threat vectors\\r\\nrelevant to the organization.\\r\\n•Refinement  Through  Iteration:Engaging  with  LLMs  inan  iterative  process  can  help  refine  goals  and  resolve\\r\\nambiguities.  This  iterative  dialogue  can  include  phased\\r\\nquestioning  or  progressively  detailed  prompts  based  on\\r\\ninitial LLM responses.\\r\\nThe  work  of  trying  various  context  breadth  strategies  to\\r\\nfind  a  reasonable  baseline  is  often  a  fruitful  activity  and  can\\r\\ninform future starting points. A broad prompt might yield an\\r\\noverly general IRP, whereas a specific prompt, such as the one\\r\\nillustrated  in  Figure  6,  “[...]  for  a  stolen  device  [...]  outline\\r\\nan IRP and identify SOPs [...],” leads to a more tailored and\\r\\nactionable response.\\r\\nThe quality and effectiveness of the resulting IRPs and SOPs\\r\\nare  directly  influenced  by  the  specificity  of  the  initial  goals.\\r\\nSpecific  goals  lead  to  IRPs  and  SOPs  that  are  more  aligned\\r\\nwith  the  organization’s  specific  risk  profile  and  operational\\r\\nneeds, thereby enhancing their applicability and effectiveness\\r\\nin mitigating security risks.\\r\\nIncorporating  a  feedback  loop  in  the  goal-setting  process\\r\\nensures  that  the  development  of  IRPs  and  SOPs  remains\\r\\ndynamic and responsive. Initial outputs from the LLM should\\r\\nbe  evaluated  by  key  personnel  within  the  organization,  and\\r\\nthe  insights  gained  used  to  further  refine  and  specify  goals,\\r\\nthereby optimizing the relevance and applicability of the LLM-\\r\\ngenerated content.\\r\\nB.  Measurable\\r\\nMeasurement of the output of an LLM-assisted IRP or SOP\\r\\ncan feel imprecise if the output is not of a mathematical nature.\\r\\nHowever,  it  can  be  strengthened  by  requesting  flowcharts\\r\\nor  other  types  of  diagrams,  such  as  state-machines,  where\\r\\nappropriate.  We  see  in  Figure  7  that  ChatGPT  was  able  to\\r\\nproduce a flowchart representing the output of the request.\\r\\nFlowcharts  can  often  be  turned  into  Finite  State  Machines\\r\\nfor  potentially  easier  analysis  and  completeness  tests.

This  can  make  using  a  formal\\r\\nsolver, such as Z3 or others, easily available for more rigorous\\r\\nanalysis. It is, however, unlikely that this specific level of rigor\\r\\nwill be needed for SOPs or IRPs because they areusuallysmall\\r\\nenough for a human to reason about.

Specifically,  an  LLM  can  analyze  a  list  of  existing\\r\\nSOPs alongside names of forthcoming candidate SOPs to help\\r\\nidentify  those  of  the  highest  value  in  the  near  term.  This\\r\\nassessment is not limited to a technical perspective but extends\\r\\nto  regulatory  and  compliance  considerations  as  well.  This\\r\\napproach  is  particularly  effective  when  the  context  has  been\\r\\nset regarding which regulations are applicable to the business,\\r\\nallowing  the  LLM  to  tailor  its  recommendations  to  ensure\\r\\ncompliance and address critical security needs.\\r\\n1)  Utilizing  LLMs  for  Strategic  Prioritization:LLMs  can\\r\\nprovide invaluable assistance in identifying and prioritizing the\\r\\ndevelopment of IRPs and SOPs by:\\r\\n•Analyzing current cybersecurity posture of the organiza-tion  and  identifying  gaps  where  additional  SOPs  could\\r\\nfortify the organization’s defenses.\\r\\n•Reviewing  the  latest  cybersecurity  threats  and  trends  torecommend  updates  to  existing  SOPs  or  the  creation  of\\r\\nnew ones that address emerging risks.\\r\\n•Considering  the  regulatory  landscape  to  ensure  that  allrecommended SOPs align with compliance requirements,\\r\\nthereby minimizing legal and financial risks.\\r\\nFurthermore,  LLMs  can  facilitate  stakeholder  engagement\\r\\nby synthesizing complex security and compliance information\\r\\ninto digestible, executive-level summaries. This capability en-\\r\\nhances decision-making processes by providing clear, concise\\r\\ndata  on  which  aspects  of  incident  response  planning  should\\r\\nbe prioritized to align with business objectives and regulatory\\r\\nmandates.\\r\\n2)  Continuous Improvement and Adaptation:The dynamic\\r\\nnature  of  cybersecurity  threats  necessitates  a  continuous  im-\\r\\nprovement approach to IRP and SOP development.

Time-bound\\r\\nThe cybersecurity landscape ever changing, and new threats\\r\\nand  vulnerabilities  are  constant  as  are  techniques  and  tactics\\r\\nused  by  threat  actors.  In  this  context,  the  swift  identification\\r\\nand  development  of  IRPs  and  SOPs  for  new  scenarios  and\\r\\nnew technologies is absolutely critical. Strong SOPs should be\\r\\nbroadly applicable and reusable, but as unexpected responses\\r\\nare  needed,  an  SOP  supported  by  deep  analysis  should  be\\r\\nwritten  (e.g.,  an  SOP  for  disconnecting  a  campus  from  the\\r\\nInternet).  This  section  explores  the  criticality  of  setting  and\\r\\nadhering to time-bound objectives in crafting IRPs and SOPs,\\r\\nwith a focus on leveraging LLMs to streamline this process.\\r\\n1)  Setting  Realistic  Timelines:A  thorough  assessment  of\\r\\nan  organization’s  existing  incident  response  capabilities  and\\r\\nresources  lays  the  groundwork  for  realistic  timeline  setting.\\r\\nUnderstanding the starting point is essential for accurate plan-\\r\\nning and expectation management. LLMs excel in identifying\\r\\ngaps within existing IRPs and SOPs by analyzing vast amounts\\r\\nof  data  and  comparing  them  with  current  best  practices  and\\r\\ncompliance standards. This capability allows organizations to\\r\\nidentify gaps within the procedures on which new procedures\\r\\nare being built. This helps identify antecedent tasks that may\\r\\nbe needed before those under consideration can be built.\\r\\nLLMs  can  dramatically  reduce  the  time  required  to  draft\\r\\ncomprehensive  IRPs  and  SOPs.  By  inputting  organizational\\r\\nspecifics  and  compliance  requirements,  LLMs  can  generate\\r\\ninitial  drafts  that  teams  can  refine,  significantly  accelerating\\r\\nthe development process.\\r\\n2)  Incorporating Time-bound Goals into IRP/SOP Develop-\\r\\nment:Establishing specific milestones within the IRP and SOP\\r\\ndevelopment  process  is  crucial.  For  instance,  completing  the\\r\\ndraft of an IRP within four weeks or finalizing a set of SOPs by\\r\\nthe end of the quarter provides clear targets for the team to aim\\r\\nfor. Furthermore, allocating time for feedback and revisions is\\r\\nessential for an iterative approach aiming to optimize the plan.\\r\\nSetting clear deadlines for each review phase ensures that the\\r\\ndevelopment  process  remains  on  track,  allowing  for  iterative\\r\\nimprovements without derailing the overall timeline.\\r\\nThe unexpected can occur in the security space, which may\\r\\nnegatively impact the timeline. To reduce the risk of missing\\r\\na deadline due to unplanned higher-priority tasks, scheduling\\r\\nregular  progress  reviews  helps  monitor  the  advancement  of\\r\\nIRP  and  SOP  development  against  the  established  timeline.\\r\\nThese  check-ins  facilitate  timely  adjustments  to  the  plan,\\r\\nensuring  that  the  development  process  remains  aligned  with\\r\\nthe set objectives.\\r\\nF.  Post-mortems & Retrospectives\\r\\nAs  an  incident  unfolds,  maintaining  detailed  records  is\\r\\nparamount  not  only  for  evidence  preservation  but  also  for\\r\\na  comprehensive  post-incident  analysis.  These  records  serve\\r\\nmultiple purposes, such as elucidating communication dynam-\\r\\nics and decision-making processes during the incident.\\r\\nFollowing  an  incident,  organizations  commonly  conduct  a\\r\\n“Post-mortem” or “Retrospective” meeting—terms that, while\\r\\nsometimes used interchangeably, may convey nuanced differ-\\r\\nences depending on the operational framework.

The\\r\\nlack of structure and clear objectives to T1 analyses makes\\r\\noperative inefficiencies hard to spot, SOC performance hard\\r\\nto measure (and therefore improve), results in overall lower\\r\\nsecurity for the monitored environment(s), and contributes to\\r\\nanalyst burnout. In this work we collaborate with a commer-\\r\\ncial SOC to devise a 4-stage (network) threat analysis process\\r\\nto support the collection and analysis of relevant information\\r\\nfor threat analysis. We conduct an experiment with ten T1 an-\\r\\nalysts employed in the SOC and show that analysts following\\r\\nthe proposed process are 2.5 times more likely to produce an\\r\\naccurate assessment than analysts who do not. We evaluate\\r\\nqualitatively the effects of the process on analysts decisions,\\r\\nand discuss implications for practice and research.\\r\\n1  Introduction\\r\\nAs the volume and sophistication of cyber-attacks increase,\\r\\nthe security of networks and systems is of key societal and\\r\\neconomic importance.Security Operation Centers(SOCs)\\r\\nare business units (within a larger organizational setting), or\\r\\nservices (that typically sell managed security services such\\r\\nas security monitoring to third party organizations) whose\\r\\npurpose is to detect cyber-attacks within the monitored envi-\\r\\nronments. Their effectiveness is of primary importance both\\r\\noperationally (to maintain security) and strategically (to deter\\r\\nattacks) [6,31].

This tiered system generates\\r\\na procedure whereby T1 analysts analyze plentiful of false\\r\\npositive alerts (i.e., that are ‘not interesting’ for escalation) [2]\\r\\nand pass on relevant information to higher tiers for more in-\\r\\ndepth investigation on alerts for which T1s cannot rule out\\r\\nevidence of attack [14].\\r\\nThus, the timeliness, accuracy, and relevancy of the infor-\\r\\nmation T1 analysts pass on to T2/T3 analysts is crucial to\\r\\neffective and efficient SOC operations, and by extension to the\\r\\nsecurity of the monitored environments. Despite this, in many\\r\\nSOCs, the actions that SOC analysts take and the information\\r\\nthey seek to inform their decisions depends mainly on tacit\\r\\nknowledge and their own background [5,23], as opposed to\\r\\na clear structure or framework to identify relevant evidence\\r\\nleading to well-informed decisions. T1 analysts typically do\\r\\nreceive training, but generally in the form of internal proce-\\r\\ndures, systems, and new vulnerabilities [22], rather than in\\r\\nthe form of an evidence-based decision-making process for\\r\\neffective threat analysis. This can lead to large differences in\\r\\naccuracy across T1 analysts [26,28]. An unstructured analysis\\r\\nprocess can also be problematic in terms of the information\\r\\npassed over to a T2 analyst when an alert is escalated. T2 an-\\r\\nalysts then need to process reports that are less standardized,\\r\\ncoherent and actionable.\\r\\nPartially mitigating this issue, most SOCs implement so-\\r\\ncalled ‘playbooks’ or ‘runbooks’,documenting the procedures\\r\\nT1 analysts should follow when analyzing alerts related to a\\r\\ncertain use case (e.g. a use case for ‘ransomware’). However,\\r\\nplaybook documents are known to have update and mainte-\\r\\nnance issues, or only cover generic use cases that may induce\\r\\nanalysts to use them less than originally intended [5]. In other\\r\\nextreme cases, some managed SOCs employ playbooks that\\r\\nare, in essence, automation rules to report information back\\r\\nto their customers.

This is problematic\\r\\nconsidering the dynamic nature of cyber-attacks, and the high\\r\\nrate of false positives generated by detectors [2]. Indeed, the\\r\\nrelevant literature suggests that analysts perform better when\\r\\ntrained on a large variety of threats whose investigation re-\\r\\nquire high cognitive engagement, as opposed to executing\\r\\npre-determined tasks [8]. In addition, automaton execution\\r\\npossibly leads to a higher likelihood of burnout [22]. For these\\r\\ncombined reasons, numerous previous studies have stressed\\r\\nthe importance of humans and their decision making abilities\\r\\nin a SOC [10,22,31]. In this work we focus on supporting T1\\r\\nanalysts’ cognitive engagement by proposing a general frame-\\r\\nwork (‘structure’) to guide the T1 through the threat analysis\\r\\nprocess. More specifically, we collaborate with a commercial\\r\\nSOC (the Eindhoven Security Hub SOC1) to devise, together\\r\\nwith three senior analysts, a structure for the T1 threat analysis\\r\\nprocess. We then evaluate the effects of the proposed process\\r\\nvia a controlled experiment with 10 T1 analysts recruited at\\r\\nthe SOC jointly analyzing 200 alerts from a real monitored\\r\\nenvironment.\\r\\nScope and contribution.The aim of this paper is to evaluate\\r\\nwhether the creative cognitive process behind threat analysis\\r\\ncan be aided by providing analysts with guidance on what\\r\\ninformation to collect to address specific ‘stages’ of the threat\\r\\nanalysis process. This is different from building an ‘algorithm’\\r\\nor set of heuristics to automate analyst decisions, which is\\r\\nnot within the scope of this paper. In terms of scope of the\\r\\nproposed process, we focus on network event analysis.\\r\\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Sec-\\r\\ntion2introduces the background on the role of T1 analysts in\\r\\nSOCs, their security analysis process, and discusses related\\r\\nwork. Section3presents the research questions addressed in\\r\\nthis work, and Section4describes the methodology to answer\\r\\nthem. Section5presents our baseline threat analysis process\\r\\nin detail and Section6provides the results to validate our pro-\\r\\ncess. Finally, Section7discusses our findings and Section8\\r\\nprovides conclusions.\\r\\n2  Background and Related Work\\r\\n2.1  SOCs and tier 1 analysts\\r\\nA security operation center (SOC) is a provider of security ser-\\r\\nvices to organizations. SOCs can be internal, where they pro-\\r\\nvide security services to their own (often large) organization,\\r\\nor external by providing security services to third parties. The\\r\\nsecurity services provided by SOCs can range from network\\r\\nintrusion detection systems (NIDS), to endpoint detection\\r\\nand firewall monitoring. The tools providing these services\\r\\nmay utilize static detection mechanisms, dynamic systems,\\r\\nmachine learning, artificial intelligence and more. However,\\r\\n1https://www.eindhovensecurityhub.nl/\\r\\nmost of these technical security solutions in an operational\\r\\nSOC generate security events which are in the first instance\\r\\nevaluated by a T1 analyst in the SOC. The analysis performed\\r\\nby T1 analysts aims to discern interesting security events\\r\\nfrom not interesting events. In other words, identify ‘interest-\\r\\ning’ security events to escalate to T2 and T3 security analysts\\r\\nfor further investigation, communication to customers and\\r\\npossible mitigation actions.\\r\\nSince T1 analysts are the first to analyze and classify se-\\r\\ncurity events, the accuracy and timeliness of their analysis is\\r\\nfundamental to a SOC. Indeed, an accurate and timely identi-\\r\\nfication of a cyber-attack minimizes the time available for the\\r\\nattack to complete [8], or may prevent its impact to be fully re-\\r\\nalized. Unfortunately,investigations performed by T1 analysts\\r\\nare known to be, in general, error prone and time-consuming,\\r\\ndespite being repetitive [10,12,22,31]. Naturally, the quality\\r\\nof the analysis and thus the accuracy of the classification is\\r\\ndependent on the individual skill of the analyst. However, ex-\\r\\nternal factors can impact this significantly, such as the arrival\\r\\nof external vulnerability information, or the addition of a new\\r\\nnetwork segment in scope of an analyst’s monitoring. Given\\r\\nthat this occurs regularly, yet not necessarily predictably, the\\r\\nquality of security event analyses can be quite variable [26].\\r\\n2.2  The security analysis process\\r\\nThe analysis process of a T1 analyst has as input a security\\r\\nevent, and as output a classification of this security event.\\r\\nRegardless of internal taxonomies, analysts can in general\\r\\nassign a security event to one of two groups: alerts worthy\\r\\nof escalation to a higher tier for further investigation (further\\r\\nreferred to as ‘interesting’ alerts), and those who should not be\\r\\nescalated (further referred to as ‘not interesting’ alerts) [10].2\\r\\nTo arrive at this conclusion, the analyst’s job is to look for\\r\\nevidence relating to the security event under analysis with\\r\\nother (security or network) events from any available and\\r\\nrelevant source, with the goal of performing a triage for a\\r\\npossible escalation to higher tiers [6,19,29].\\r\\nThe T1 analysts’ workflow takes as input a large volume\\r\\nof information that a SOC analyst has to account for in order\\r\\nto classify a security alert. They may look at the source and\\r\\ndestination IP addresses [7,23], at an increase in activities\\r\\non a certain network port [7], or at the packet size and the\\r\\ncontent of a payload [7]. From the literature we identify four\\r\\nmain categories of information that is considered by an an-\\r\\nalyst:Relevance indicators, evaluating whether an alert is\\r\\nrelevant to the scope of the analysis [6];Additional alerts,\\r\\nconsidering whether other evidence exists that an attack may\\r\\nbe ongoing [6,7];Contextual information, evaluating whether\\r\\nsome evidence of an attack is present at or around the affected\\r\\nhosts or systems [7,21];Attack Evidence, evaluating whether\\r\\n2More fine-grained evaluations (e.g., Command & Control traffic, suspi-\\r\\ncious/benign scanning activity, ..) are always possible and commonly em-\\r\\nployed in SOCs as ‘metadata’ attached to the categorization above.\\r\\n98    Nineteenth Symposium on Usable Privacy and SecurityUSENIX Association\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"p9dG9t3C2hOEFYm5QX6hB0hABw3qiPv37LK7tM0Qr48=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf_4":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf_4\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":4,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nthere is evidence that the events generating the alert led to a\\r\\n(successful) attack [6]. Table1provides a summary.\\r\\nOn the other hand, different analysts are known to employ\\r\\ndifferent strategies to analyse a specific alert [26,28]. Indeed,\\r\\nthere is no clear framework of reference on what information\\r\\nto collect and what evidence is relevant to which phase of\\r\\nthe investigation [2]. This suggests that there is no one clear\\r\\npredefined process for T1 analysts to follow, and that analy-\\r\\nsis results are entirely left to an analyst’s own background,\\r\\nknowledge, and skills [23]. This may lead to increased analyst\\r\\nburnout [14], and is particularly undesirable given the high-\\r\\nturnover nature of T1 analysts within SOCs (that are regularly\\r\\nsubstituted by more junior and inexperienced analysts).\\r\\n2.3  Related Work\\r\\nMost of the previous research on SOC analysts focuses on\\r\\nthe work process of the SOC as a whole rather than specific\\r\\nroles within the SOC. Of the papers mentioned in this section,\\r\\nthree are qualitative studies [6,14,23] and two include some\\r\\nquantitative results [28,30]. Furthermore, previous work can\\r\\nbe divided in those that specifically consider the alert analysis\\r\\nprocess of SOC analysts [6,23,28] (although with the abstrac-\\r\\ntion level of SOCs as a whole) or those who consider the work\\r\\nof the analysts from an organizational perspective [14,22].\\r\\nD’Amico and Whitley [6] conducted a cognitive task anal-\\r\\nysis (CTA) on the general workflow of a SOC, the security\\r\\nanalysis process and the decision making process of an an-\\r\\nalyst. The authors identified a tiered system where a large\\r\\nvolume of data enters the SOC, and that in each tier data is\\r\\neither discarded or retained to transfer to the next tier. Their\\r\\nwork identifies several pieces of information that SOC an-\\r\\nalysts utilize to analyze security events and based on the\\r\\nCTA the authors draw conclusions on how visualization tools\\r\\ncan and should integrate in the SOC enviroment. Although\\r\\ntheir work does not conduct a CTA for specific roles within\\r\\nthe SOC (e.g T1 analyst), it provides an overview of how\\r\\nthe SOC as a whole analyze and handle incoming security\\r\\nevents. Similarly, Zhong et al. [28], captured analysis opera-\\r\\ntions performed by analysts in a SOC and the hypotheses they\\r\\ngenerate and utilize in this process. The authors conduct CTA\\r\\nto capture fine-grained processes performed as part of the\\r\\nalert analysis. Interestingly, the authors highlight the obser-\\r\\nvation that analysts employ different strategies and processes\\r\\nto explore the data and generate hypotheses to investigate. In\\r\\nlater work Zhong et al. [30] propose a tool that automates\\r\\nthe data triage aspect of aT1 analyst’s work. They observed\\r\\nhigh-performance and satisfactory false-positive rates. They\\r\\ndo note, however, that the quality of the system depends on\\r\\nthe quality of the triage traces, which in turn depends on the\\r\\nquality of the analyst. Notably, this approach utilizes the op-\\r\\nerations of the analysts, such as “searching”,“selecting” and\\r\\n“filtering” [30], and does not capture why an analyst performs\\r\\nthis action, nor what evidence is obtained from this operation.\\r\\nKokulu et al. conducted a qualitative study on issues within\\r\\nthe SOC [14]. One of the primary findings is the current\\r\\nmetrics for SOC performance are not effective. Moreover,\\r\\nthis is a point of contention between security analysts and\\r\\ntheir managers. They also found the speed of response and\\r\\nthe level of automation to be similarly (and very) important\\r\\nfor effective SOC operations. Additionally, they noted that\\r\\npoor analyst training and high false-positive rates are issues\\r\\nwithin the SOCs in their research. This all culminates into\\r\\npoor quality of analyses, if left unaddressed.\\r\\nAnother interesting observation noted by Sunderamurthy\\r\\net al [23] is the problem of tacit knowledge within the SOC;\\r\\ndecisions made by security analysts are based on intuition and\\r\\nnot documented. Often, the security analysts cannot clearly\\r\\ncommunicate their knowledge related to the incident and the\\r\\nreason for their classification of this incident [23]. This is\\r\\na key component of the services provided by SOCs, as the\\r\\ncontact point for the monitored environment must be provided\\r\\nwith accurate and actionable evidence of a security incident.\\r\\nThe contact person must be convinced that mitigation is neces-\\r\\nsary and warrant a potential interruption of business processes.\\r\\nT1 security analysts must do this as well when escalating to T2\\r\\nor T3 analysts. Good communication about what a T1 analyst\\r\\nhas observed, supporting evidence and their decision process\\r\\nis therefore a must in an effective SOC. On this line, [23]\\r\\nreports that “SOC jobs such as incident response and forensic\\r\\nanalysis have become so sophisticated and expertise driven\\r\\nthat understanding the process is nearly impossible without\\r\\ndoing the job.”\\r\\n3Problem Statement and Research Questions\\r\\nThe process of alert investigation  is repetitive, time-\\r\\nconsuming and error prone [10,12,22,31]. Much research\\r\\nhas been done on the automation of individual steps or parts\\r\\nof the investigation, such as correlation and alert reduction,\\r\\noften relying on automated learning techniques [24,31]. Past\\r\\nresearch also provided an high level overview of the workflow\\r\\nof an analyst [6,7,28]. However, to our knowledge a clear\\r\\nstructure of the investigative process, and an evaluation of the\\r\\nextent to which it would aid in accurate decision making by\\r\\nT1 analysts, is currently missing [25]. The problem statement\\r\\nabove gives rise to the following two research questions:\\r\\nRQ1: Which sequence of tasks and information gathering\\r\\nshould a tier 1 analyst perform when executing a threat analy-\\r\\nsis process to analyze network security alerts?\\r\\nRQ2: To what extent can the derived threat analysis process\\r\\nincrease the accuracy of classifying network security alerts\\r\\nfor tier 1 analysts?\\r\\nUSENIX AssociationNineteenth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security    99\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"TpQdiZb9WShrCLLjJ0Ipa0nR3WsYWwPSU0niqGSHZDg=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf_5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf_5\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nTable 1: Categories of information SOC analysts employ to classify alerts\\r\\nInformation Category                                   Definition                                  References\\r\\nRelevance indicatorsInformation to classify whether the alert under investigation is even relevant for the\\r\\nSOC, based on the signature and the scope of the customer.\\r\\n[2,6]\\r\\nAdditional alertsAlerts related to the current alert that the analyst is investigating.

To derive the threat analysis process we worked closely\\r\\nwith a T2 security analysis expert with 4+ years of experience\\r\\nwho is currently active in the SOC to identify which infor-\\r\\nmation a T1 analyst should consider for the ‘escalation’ of\\r\\nthe alert to be useful for the higher-tier analysts. The derived\\r\\ninformation was then mapped to the categories presented in\\r\\nTable1and used to build a step-wise process for the analysis.\\r\\nThis process was then iteratively and independently evalu-\\r\\nated by two senior analysts (with respectively 15+ and 10+\\r\\nyears of experience) active in the SOC, until all three experts\\r\\nwere in agreement on the resulting threat analysis process.\\r\\nImplementation details and results are given in Section5.\\r\\nRQ2. To validate the identified threat analysis process we\\r\\ndesigned an experiment to compare the performance of SOC\\r\\nanalysts who employ the process to conduct analysis of alert\\r\\ndata in the SOC, against that of analysts who do not. We\\r\\nemploy sensor data from one of the organizations monitored\\r\\nby the SOC to sample alerts from a real-life environment. This\\r\\nensures that baseline information (such as the IP space of that\\r\\norganization) is already known to the analysts. In addition to\\r\\nusing alerts from our sensor, we generated additional alerts by\\r\\ninjecting attacks into the virtual SOC environment to validate\\r\\nour process on alerts relating to successful attacks. To not\\r\\naffect SOC operations, we reproduce a near identical virtual\\r\\nenvironment that T1 analysts employ in the SOC in their\\r\\nday to day work (details of the environment can be found\\r\\nin AppendixB), and recruit our subjects from the pool of\\r\\nanalysts employed at the time at the SOC.\\r\\n4.1  Synthesis of the threat analysis process\\r\\nFigure1provides an overview of the iterative process we\\r\\nemploy to construct our proposed threat analysis process.\\r\\nPreliminary alert analysis.In order to establish a set of in-\\r\\nformation a T1 analyst should collect we adopted a bottom-up\\r\\nTier 2 Analyst\\r\\n3 alerts10 alerts\\r\\nTier 3 Analyst\\r\\nAnalyze\\r\\nNote feedback andanalysis\\r\\nSend Process\\r\\nCreate/Upgradethreat analysis\\r\\nprocess\\r\\nAnalyze withprocess\\r\\nEvaluate\\r\\nAnalyze withprocess\\r\\nSend Feedback\\r\\nEvaluateResearcherTier 2 Analyst\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\n3\\r\\n3\\r\\nFigure 1: Synthesis of the baseline threat analysis process\\r\\napproach and sampled a set of 10 security alerts from a proto-\\r\\ntype sensor of the SOC. This relatively low number of alerts\\r\\nwas chosen in first instance under the observation (and in\\r\\nconsultation with the involved SOC experts) that the T1 anal-\\r\\nysis process is very repetitive and does not vary significantly\\r\\nacross (network) security alerts. To make sure saturation in\\r\\nthe collected information steps is reached, we adopted a step-\\r\\nwise process whereby additional information of relevance to\\r\\nthe process is added to the set as each new alert is analyzed.\\r\\nThe ten sampled alerts consist of malware, exploits, com-\\r\\nmand & control, policy violations and scan alerts.

From the SOC environment we sampled\\r\\n200 alerts and divided these in ten batches (‘scenarios’) of\\r\\n20 alerts each. We then recruited ten T1 analysts and asked\\r\\nthem to analyse four batches of alerts each (for a total 80 alert\\r\\nanalyses per analyst);3each analyst was assigned to either the\\r\\ntreatment group (i.e., following the proposed process for the\\r\\nanalysis) or the control group, and asked to classify each alert\\r\\nas either ‘interesting’ or ‘not interesting’. These assessments\\r\\nare then compared against a ground truth of assessments (de-\\r\\nfined by the SOC’s T2 analyst) to evaluate differences in\\r\\naccuracy between the treatment and control groups. In the fol-\\r\\nlowing, we describe our choice of subjects, how we designed\\r\\nthe sets of alerts per subject, how we derived the ground truth\\r\\nand the details of the experimental setup.\\r\\nSubjects.We recruited as subjects of our experiment ten ju-\\r\\nnior analysts over a period of six months, in two batches of\\r\\nfive analysts each. To maintain comparable experience levels\\r\\nacross recruited analysts, we recruited them immediately after\\r\\nthey joined the SOC. T1 analysts in the SOC are structurally\\r\\nhired as interns from the security program at a technical uni-\\r\\nversity in Europe. Their turnover rate varies between four\\r\\nand six months of employment.4All subjects are assessed be-\\r\\nfore joining the team for their background, and are given the\\r\\nsame technical on-the-job training. Analysts in the treatment\\r\\ngroup were given an additional training on the devised threat\\r\\nanalysis process they will employ during the experiment.\\r\\nDesigning alert sets.Collecting ‘baseline’ alert data.To\\r\\nmaintain realism of the experimental setup, we collected\\r\\nalerts from the network environment of a customer of the\\r\\nSOC over the course of 2.5 weeks. To make sure the collected\\r\\nalerts were not already investigated by our subjects as part\\r\\nof their normal job activities, we selected a network whose\\r\\n3In consultation with the T2 and T3 analysts involved in this research,\\r\\nwe estimated an average assessment time of 10 minutes per alert.

The environ-\\r\\nment from which the alert data is collected comprises over\\r\\n1500 unique hosts and multiple DNS and file servers. We\\r\\nlogged approximately 100M connections attempts and 48M\\r\\nDNS requests. These connections generated 350k security\\r\\nevents distributed across 150 unique security alerts. As SOC\\r\\ndata are over-represented by alerts of certain kinds (e.g. alerts\\r\\nrelated to scan activities), we employed a stratified random\\r\\nsampling method over the collected alerts. We employ the\\r\\n‘rule category’ [17] attribute that comes with alerts to define\\r\\nthe type of each alert. The considered alert categories are:\\r\\nScan,Malware,CnCandPolicy. From each of the rule cate-\\r\\ngories, we randomly selected a unique rule, and from that we\\r\\nsampled a random alert generated by that rule.\\r\\nGenerating ‘successful’ attacks.To generate ‘interesting’\\r\\nalerts we could not rely on existing data in the SOC, as ac-\\r\\ntual attacks are rare. We therefore employed PCAP network\\r\\ntraffic from malware-traffic-analysis.net [15], which provides\\r\\nrecords of malicious network traffic of (multi-stage) malware\\r\\nattacks, to inject simulated attacks to the SOC sensors gen-\\r\\nerating security alerts. Details of the attacks are reported in\\r\\nAppendixA. To assure the realism of the attacks, IP addresses\\r\\nin the obtained PCAPS are adapted to those expected within\\r\\nthe range of the monitored network from which the ‘baseline\\r\\ndata’ is derived. To avoid conflicts in the data,only unassigned\\r\\nIP addresses are used to rewrite the PCAPs; only internal IPs\\r\\nto the infected network were changed (i.e. IPs of the malware\\r\\ninfrastructure remained unaltered). DNS servers used in the\\r\\nattacks are set to be the actual internal DNS servers in that\\r\\nsub-net, reflecting the corporate policy for the sub-net of the\\r\\nmonitored environment.

The process guides the analyst in collecting\\r\\nevidence of an attack through the four identified stages; at\\r\\nthe end of the process, the analyst decides whether there is\\r\\nenough evidence to classify the alert as ‘interesting’, or not.6\\r\\nThe rest of this section details each step for every stage within\\r\\nthe proposed threat analysis process.\\r\\n5.1  Relevance Indicators\\r\\nThe first process stage consists of three steps; signature speci-\\r\\nficity (SiS), signature age (SiA) and customer scope (CS).\\r\\nSignature specificity.To determine ‘specificity’, the ana-\\r\\nlyst first determines whether the triggered signature is specific\\r\\nto a certain attack or service, or whether it is only a generic\\r\\nindicator of an attack. This step allows one to establish the ini-\\r\\ntial priority of the alert analysis (e.g. specific indicators may\\r\\nbe prioritised over generic indicators), as well as determine\\r\\nwhat to investigate in future steps.

This\\r\\nsignals the age of associated threat, or indicates a potentially\\r\\nnot interesting security event if the trigger conditions of the\\r\\nindicator are time-dependent.\\r\\nCustomer scope.The analyst determines if the alert is\\r\\nwithin the monitored scope by reviewing if necessary the cus-\\r\\ntomer security policy, as well as the service level agreements\\r\\nabout sub-nets and reporting. The alerts with no to low impact,\\r\\nfor example a guest network of the customer, can in this way\\r\\nbe evaluated early on in the process as lower priority.\\r\\n5.2  Additional alerts.\\r\\nThe second stage consists of two steps; alert history (AH) and\\r\\nsurrounding alerts (SA).\\r\\nAlert history.The analyst investigates the history of the\\r\\nalert under investigation. Namely, how often the alert has been\\r\\ntriggered in the past, how often it was considered interesting,\\r\\nand whether it triggered for the same internal host before.\\r\\nUsing this information, an analyst can verify quickly whether\\r\\nthe observed alert is a common false positive or not. If past\\r\\noccurrences have been flagged as ‘not interesting’ due to them\\r\\nbeing false positives, the analyst can consider that the alert\\r\\nunder investigation may be a false positive as well.\\r\\nSurrounding alerts.The analyst investigates additional\\r\\nalerts similar to the one under investigation that were triggered\\r\\nby one or multiple of the involved hosts, around the time of\\r\\nthe potential attack. When looking at these surrounding alerts,\\r\\nanalysts may observe different alerts with similar names, indi-\\r\\ncating the same potential attack. This adds evidence that the\\r\\nevent underlying these alerts may be interesting. Additionally\\r\\nthe analyst may observe alerts for different phases of an attack,\\r\\nfurther strengthening the case for continuing to investigate the\\r\\nalert. For example, investigating a malware alert, a surround-\\r\\ning alert may be CnC activity. Identifying these surrounding\\r\\nalerts allows the analyst to get a more encompassing picture\\r\\nof an ongoing attack, if present.\\r\\n5.3  Contextual information.\\r\\nThe third stage consists of four steps; related logs (RL), traf-\\r\\nfic stream information (TSI), target host information (THI)\\r\\nand target hosts behaviour (THB). At this stage, the analyst\\r\\ncollects concrete evidence generated by the security systems,\\r\\nand information provided by the owner of the monitored envi-\\r\\nronment.

This selection is largely dependent on the type of\\r\\nalert, and the type of traffic it is triggered on. In general,RL\\r\\nconsists of at least a connection log, a protocol specific log\\r\\n(such as HTTP, or SSH), in addition to the alert log. Further-\\r\\nmore, any other logs generated by the receiving host of the\\r\\nprotocol in the alert, or DNS logs, are typically related.\\r\\nTraffic stream information.The analyst considers more\\r\\ndetailed information about the packets sent to and from the\\r\\nhost. This information can include the total number of bytes\\r\\nand packets sent by the attacker and defender, and the data\\r\\ncontained in those packets. The protocol used between the\\r\\ncommunication of the attacker and defender is an important\\r\\nconsideration in this step as it determines whether the number\\r\\nof packets and the data contained in them are abnormal or not\\r\\nin the specific context. For example, this step allows analysts\\r\\nto identify successful port scans by verifying if a response\\r\\npacket was sent back to the source. This also allows analysts\\r\\nto determine whether any ‘lucky hits’, were generated. A\\r\\n‘lucky hit’ occurs when the trigger conditions of a signature\\r\\n(typically a non-specific one, as assessed in theSiSstep) are\\r\\nmet by pure chance on a random sequence of bytes, and thus\\r\\ntrigger on benign traffic, producing false-positives.\\r\\nTarget host information.The analyst can utilize infor-\\r\\nmation about the host, such as whether it is a desktop or a\\r\\nserver, its purpose (for example DNS server), its OS, its as-\\r\\nsociated sub-net, host name, open ports and so on, to reason\\r\\nabout whether the attack under investigation can ever lead to\\r\\nsuccessful violation of corporate policies. This step can vary\\r\\ngreatly from SOC to SOC and even from monitored environ-\\r\\nment to monitored environment, as corporate policies differ\\r\\nbetween organizations.\\r\\nTarget host behaviour.Next to utilizing known informa-\\r\\ntion about the targeted host, the analyst reviews the current\\r\\nbehaviorof the targeted host. For this,the logs produced by the\\r\\nIDS and network sniffer are utilized to review the behaviour\\r\\nof the host before and after the attack. If the host behaves ab-\\r\\nnormally compared to how the hosts normally would behave,\\r\\nit may indicate that the host was impacted by the attack.\\r\\n5.4  Attack evidence\\r\\nThis stage consists of four steps; attack/exploit information\\r\\n(A/EI), attack success indicators (ASI), attacker information\\r\\n(AI) and relation to the use cases (RUC).\\r\\nAttack/Exploit information.In this step, the analyst de-\\r\\ntermines the exact attack and tools involved. The information\\r\\nrequired to determine this originates from the signature which\\r\\ntriggered the alert, and open source information about the cor-\\r\\nresponding attack. From this step, it should be clear whether\\r\\nthere is an attack, and if so what attack specifically. Using\\r\\nthis information, in relation to that collected in the previous\\r\\nsteps (e.g.RL,THI) the analyst estimates how this specific\\r\\nattack can have impact on the customer.\\r\\nAttacker information.The analyst investigates the be-\\r\\nhaviour of the attacker (or at least of the attacking system).\\r\\nUsing the logs generated as a result of the attacker behaviour,\\r\\nas well as using public sources, the analyst can determine\\r\\nwhether the attacker is an actual attacker. This step is needed\\r\\nto rule out known and trusted sources such as (vulnerabil-\\r\\nity) scanners, as well as help identifying false positive alerts\\r\\ngenerating ‘hits’ on backup streams, software updates, and\\r\\nbenign network downloads.\\r\\nAttack success indicators.The analyst investigates\\r\\nwhether the attack was successful. Analysts use information\\r\\nobtained from former stages and open sources that identify\\r\\nclear indicators of successful attacks. Generally, the attack\\r\\nsuccess indicators are highly dependent on the specific attack,\\r\\nhowever, generic indicators such as DNS requests for unusual\\r\\ntop-level domains or internal scanning can be used as well.\\r\\nRelation to use cases.The analyst consults the use cases\\r\\nfor the affected environment. This step helps them to correctly\\r\\nidentify the full impact for the environment, and thus the\\r\\nfinal classification of the alert. It also eliminates any alerts\\r\\nwhich are not important to the environment. For example,\\r\\ninvestigating a generic malware alert, having determined that\\r\\nit is actually adware on a desktop, the use cases may call for\\r\\nno action at all, depending on the environment. Finally, the\\r\\nuse cases may provide useful information and guidance on\\r\\nwhat to report to higher tier analysts or the affected customer.\\r\\n6  Experiment results\\r\\nTable4provides an overview of the alert analyses performed\\r\\nby our subjects. Collectively, analysts classified an alert\\r\\nas ‘interesting’ 114 times, and 686 times as ‘not interest-\\r\\ning’. Furthermore, we observe that analysts who followed\\r\\nour process classify alerts more often as ‘interesting’ (67\\r\\ntimes) than the analysts who did not follow the process (47\\r\\ntimes,χ=3.69,p=0.055). Whereas only borderline sig-\\r\\nnificant, this suggests that following the proposed process\\r\\nmay increase the likelihood of escalating an alert to a higher\\r\\ntier. Meanwhile, we do not observe any within-group dif-\\r\\nference across analysts in terms of their classification out-\\r\\nputs in either group (treatment:χ=1.36,p=0.85; control:\\r\\nχ=2.07,p=0.72). This suggests that the likelihood of an\\r\\nanalyst’s classification for a given alert may depend on the\\r\\ntreatment group the analyst is assigned to, rather than on the\\r\\nanalyst themselves.\\r\\nFocusing on analysts accuracy, we observe that overall ana-\\r\\nlysts not following our process show a accuracy of 82% in the\\r\\nclassification; by contrast, analysts following the proposed\\r\\nprocess show an overall accuracy of 92%. Interestingly, this\\r\\ndifference disappears when only considering alerts whose\\r\\nground truth classification is ‘not interesting’.

Other differences across categories are\\r\\nsmaller and not statistically significant.\\r\\n6.1  Qualitative evaluation\\r\\nWe now try to qualitatively characterize the differences be-\\r\\ntween the two groups by looking at specific classification\\r\\ntasks in the two groups. To reconstruct this, we look at the\\r\\ndata annotated by the analysts with the motivations of their\\r\\ndecisions for a classification for each specific alert.\\r\\nFirstly, from the data we observed that subjects who do not\\r\\nfollow our process typically based their decision to discard an\\r\\nalert (i.e classifying it as ‘not interesting’) after a single ‘step’\\r\\nin the decision process. For example, aCnCalert (ThreatFox\\r\\nBazarBackdoor botnet C2 traffic, whose instance in\\r\\nour data is classified as ‘interesting’ by the T2 analyst) in\\r\\nscenario no. 3 was erroneously classified by an analyst as ‘not\\r\\ninteresting’ as the network communication related to this alert\\r\\n“only” contained 10 packets. One of the analysts remarks:“Its\\r\\n[the count is] below 50. So, this alert can also be dismissed.”\\r\\nWhereas ‘50’ is not a limit specified anywhere in the SOC\\r\\nfor this type of alert, we later learned that this cut-off number\\r\\nis considered relevant for SSH brute force attacks. This sug-\\r\\ngests that the analyst erroneously considered this a universal\\r\\nthreshold when deciding whether a communication is large\\r\\nenough to be considered potentially interesting, despite the\\r\\nalert in question being completely unrelated to SSH brute\\r\\nforcing. This seems in line with the generally accepted notion\\r\\nof ‘implicit knowledge’ being employed by analysts [5,22].\\r\\nAlthough our process does not prevent these mistakes from\\r\\nhappening, following it may at least aid analysts in consider-\\r\\ning other steps as well to potentially classify alerts in a more\\r\\ninformed manner.\\r\\nIn  another  investigation  on  alertET JA3 Hash -\\r\\n[Abuse.ch] Possible Dridex, two analysts who erro-\\r\\nneously classified it as ‘not interesting’ had previously\\r\\nobserved high false positive rates with alerts associated to\\r\\n‘JA3’ hashes. Therefore, analysts investigating JA3 alerts\\r\\noften mumbled that this is most likely going to be a false\\r\\npositive. Further, this alert was associated to a limited (9)\\r\\nnumber of packets, leading analysts not following the process\\r\\nto classify it as ‘not interesting’ despite the presence of\\r\\nconcrete evidence of a connection from a suspicious IP\\r\\nbeing established with the host. By contrast, analysts in\\r\\nthe treatment group identified that this alert was related\\r\\nto another ‘interesting’ alert at theSAstep. Whereas the\\r\\nT1 analysts could not observe much of the data relating to\\r\\nthe network communication of this alert, they identified\\r\\nsufficient evidence to escalate it, considering that if the alert\\r\\nwas related to an attack it would have a high impact to the\\r\\norganization. One of the analysts following our process\\r\\nremarked the following related to this alert: “Could not tell\\r\\nthat the decoded message would have had a relation to this\\r\\ntraffic. It is still malware-related, making it more significant\\r\\nfor the customer and this same IP was also involved with\\r\\nthe Threatfox backdoor alert.” Interestingly, another analyst\\r\\nfollowing the process and correctly classifying this alert as\\r\\n‘interesting’ commented “It’s weird. JA3 is never interesting\\r\\nfor us.”. This suggests they made similar considerations to\\r\\nthe analysts not employing the process, but corrected their\\r\\nbelief on the basis of the additional evidence collected.\\r\\nWe find three cases where following the process lead\\r\\nto analysts classifying a ‘not interesting’ alert as ‘in-\\r\\nteresting’, i.e. generating a false positive classification.\\r\\nOne scan alert (ET SCAN MS Terminal Server Traffic\\r\\non Non-standard Port) was classified as ‘interesting’ be-\\r\\ncause there was insufficient evidence in one ‘step’ of the\\r\\ninvestigation. Almost all ‘steps’ in this investigation were\\r\\nleading to the conclusion that the alert was indeed not in-\\r\\nteresting. However, as the subject could not observe the be-\\r\\nhavior of the host, the subject decided to classify it as ‘in-\\r\\nteresting’ nonetheless to verify the alert with a T2 analyst.\\r\\nAnother interesting case was when an analyst over-relied\\r\\nonAIinstead of other steps in the process when investigat-\\r\\ningET SCAN ProxyReconBot CONNECT method to Mail.\\r\\nThis alert was raised despite the attempted scan receiving no\\r\\nresponse packets from the host. Yet, as the IP which was scan-\\r\\nning the network corresponded to an untrusted domain, the T1\\r\\nanalyst decided to classify the alert as ‘interesting’. Overall,\\r\\nthese errors seem to be caused by a mistaken interpretation\\r\\nof the evidence (or lack thereof) by the analyst, rather than\\r\\nbeing induced by an incorrect evaluation strategy imposed by\\r\\nthe process.\\r\\n7  Discussion\\r\\nOur findings show that analysts are significantly more likely\\r\\nto classify alerts correctly (odds increase by around 2.5 times)\\r\\nwhen following our baseline threat analysis process. This sug-\\r\\ngests that a structured process that T1 analysts can follow\\r\\ncan when compared to sole reliance on tacit knowledge [5],\\r\\naid in the correctness of security alert classification. Inter-\\r\\nestingly, in our experiment this increase in accuracy can be\\r\\nmainly attributed to ‘interesting’ alerts.

For example, ‘not interesting’\\r\\nalerts raised by attempted (but failed) port scans can often\\r\\nbe dismissed by simply observing that the host system did\\r\\nnot communicate back to the attacker. Therefore, most ana-\\r\\nlysts would classify such alerts correctly, regardless of how\\r\\nrigorously they analyse the evidence. By contrast, T1 analysts\\r\\nin our experiment struggled more with analysing ‘interest-\\r\\ning’ alerts correctly. This is unsurprising as these alerts are\\r\\nin general more complex and require the analysis of more\\r\\ninformation. Considering a delta of 20% in correct assess-\\r\\nments for ‘interesting’ alerts between the two experimental\\r\\nconditions, our results suggest that structuring the analysis\\r\\nprocess may improve the classification accuracy specifically\\r\\nfor the hardest alerts to analyze. Our example in Section6.1\\r\\nillustrates that this may be the case as analysts who do not\\r\\nfollow our process may over-rely on one information point\\r\\nand simultaneously not consider other relevant information\\r\\nrequired for the analysis, whereas analysts who do eventually\\r\\nfind the relevant information.\\r\\n7.1  Implications for practice\\r\\nTraining.SOCs conduct training for their T1 analysts to for\\r\\nexample, update analysts on the latest threats and how to\\r\\nanalyze them [8,11,14]. As the training directly improves the\\r\\neffectiveness of analysts, it is considered a crucial aspect of a\\r\\nSOC [2,11,20]. However, T1 analysts need to have a baseline\\r\\nlevel in their work, such that analysts are able to perform\\r\\nadequately even if they have not been trained on that specific\\r\\nset of alerts. By structuring the workflow of a T1 analyst, it\\r\\nstreamlines the baseline knowledge a T1 analyst should have\\r\\nin a SOC. The specific information T1 analysts should collect\\r\\nis explicitly defined, and thus SOCs can tailor their training\\r\\ntowards how to collect the required information.\\r\\nMeasuring analyst performance.It is important for SOCs to\\r\\nmeasure the performance of their analysts such that they know\\r\\nwhere different detection tools or more training are required.\\r\\nFor example, if a SOC realizes that analysts are having sig-\\r\\nnificant difficulties interpreting relevant logs, it may consider\\r\\ntraining their analysts on logs specifically. However, current\\r\\nquantitative metrics for SOC analysts often fail to measure\\r\\nthe actual performance of the analyst [14,22]. Our proposed\\r\\nthreat analysis process can standardize the workflow of T1 an-\\r\\nalysts in terms of what information they should collect during\\r\\ntheir analyses. This gives SOC managers more concrete direc-\\r\\ntions to measure the performance of their analysts, and of the\\r\\nprocesses they oversee. Although, it is out of the scope of this\\r\\npaper to present better metrics for T1 analyst performance,\\r\\nmeasuring performance of analysts at specific steps gives a\\r\\nmore accurate overview of their analysis performance as op-\\r\\nposed to only considering the number of escalated alerts [14],\\r\\nhandled alerts [22] and time needed to analyse an alert [14].\\r\\nImportantly, this may reveal ‘weak’ spots in the detection\\r\\nand escalation processes in place at a SOC, giving managers\\r\\naccurate metrics on which to base future adjustments.\\r\\nEscalation.When an alert is being escalated by a T1 analyst,\\r\\nthe analyst escalates the alert itself with supporting evidence\\r\\nwhy the alert has been escalated [13]. However, what may con-\\r\\nstitute as supporting evidence may differ for each individual\\r\\nanalyst. SOCs may have their own standards and expectations\\r\\non what T1 analysts include in their ‘ticket’. On the other\\r\\nhand, the proposed threat analysis process (or any structured\\r\\nprocess analysts can follow) can be used to provide a ticketing\\r\\nstandard that is in tune with the process that the T1 analyst\\r\\nfollow. Furthermore, by removing uncertainty on the expec-\\r\\ntations of a T2 analyst on what information they will receive\\r\\nfrom a T1 analyst, the time needed to interpret each ticket by\\r\\na T2 analyst may be reduced.\\r\\n7.2Implications for research and future work\\r\\nThere have been numerous previous studies presenting pro-\\r\\nposed tools pertaining to issues in the threat analysis process\\r\\nof SOC analysts [3,4,9,31]. In line with this, future work\\r\\ncould integrate a threat analysis process into an operational\\r\\nSOC. In our work, a subset of analysts were required to follow\\r\\nour process, however this is hard to enforce outside the con-\\r\\ntrolled experiment. Observing how analysts would classify\\r\\nreal security events using an integrated system that guides\\r\\nthem into a desired process would potentially yield interesting\\r\\ninsights into how such a process would function in practice.\\r\\nSimilarly, future work may evaluate ‘how much informa-\\r\\ntion’ is ‘enough information’ to collect to take an accurate\\r\\ndecision on a specific alert. This may aid the navigation of\\r\\nan analysis process for analysts to ‘quit’ the process early on\\r\\nwhen enough evidence has been collected to take a negative\\r\\ndecision. Similarly, the proposed process may be extended\\r\\nto other types of data, e.g. considering host or cloud log data\\r\\nrather than network (event) data.\\r\\nIn our work we focused on the accuracy of the classifica-\\r\\ntion of an analyst as the sole metric of a T1 analyst. However,\\r\\nprevious studies have shown that timeliness of analysis is\\r\\nimportant as well in an operational SOC [8,22]. Even if our\\r\\nthreat analysis process leads to a better outcome in classifi-\\r\\ncation, it would be problematic if it added a significant time\\r\\noverhead for T1 analysts. Future work could investigate how\\r\\nfollowing such a process influences the timeliness (and not\\r\\nonly the accuracy) of the classification of security events.\\r\\n7.3  Threats to validity\\r\\nConstruct validity.All injected attacks in our experiment\\r\\nconsisted of malware related attacks, where a malware is\\r\\ninstalled, the host is controlled via a command and control\\r\\nserver and where possibly some lateral movement took place\\r\\nUSENIX AssociationNineteenth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security    107\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"gRzMa2Mb6Hh8idnWnWXJLLQX4jnH8SxeEszi30N+sIw=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf_13":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf_13\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nwithin the network.

How-\\r\\never, in reality some analysts may be more skilled than others\\r\\ndespite similar job experiences and educational background.\\r\\nTo mitigate this, we checked whether concrete evidence ex-\\r\\nists that analysts influence the classification of the alerts or\\r\\nnot. Additionally, when collecting data regarding the internal\\r\\nconsistency of our process we used the response options in\\r\\nTable7in the Appendix. However, we did not test whether\\r\\nthe interpretations of the response options differ among our\\r\\nsubjects. In other words, subjects may give different responses\\r\\nto a step with the same observed data. Meanwhile, subjects\\r\\nmay give identical responses to a step even though they have\\r\\ninterpreted the data completely differently.\\r\\nExternal validity.The main threat to external validity is the\\r\\nextent to which the employed SOC represents data and oper-\\r\\nations adopted by other SOCs. SOCs vary widely over both\\r\\ndimensions as they employ different technologies and sen-\\r\\nsors, SOC operations are not standardized, and by monitoring\\r\\ndifferent networks/infrastructures they may evaluate different\\r\\nalerts over different environments [25]. However, virtually\\r\\nall SOCs at least monitor network traffic [6,16,27] and typ-\\r\\nically employ junior T1 analysts as a first line of defense to\\r\\ndecide whether to escalate or ignore incoming alerts [25]. As\\r\\nthe SOC under analysis performs only network analysis, and\\r\\nemploys T1 analysts from the same ‘pool’ as most SOCs (i.e.,\\r\\njunior staff in need of specialized cybersecurity training to\\r\\noperate well within a SOC [25]) we consider it to be represen-\\r\\ntative of SOCs in general, over these two dimensions. Further,\\r\\nas the SOC under analysisonlyperforms network monitoring,\\r\\nwe can evaluate model effects without additional confounding\\r\\nfactors caused by multiple data sources (e.g. system host logs).\\r\\nWhereas this suggests that our finding that a structured analy-\\r\\nsis process can help analysts in making accurate evaluations\\r\\nover network alerts, effect sizes may vary significantly across\\r\\nSOCs. Further research is needed to derive and evaluate analy-\\r\\nsis processes across different SOCs, monitored environments,\\r\\nand monitoring technologies, and their interactions. Addition-\\r\\nally, whereas the collaborating SOC only allows two possible\\r\\nclassifications for T1 analysts, past research [21] show that\\r\\nother SOCs may have more options to classify an alert. Our\\r\\nthreat analysis process does not incorporate such frameworks\\r\\nfor classifying alerts and thus, our process requires modifica-\\r\\ntion to accommodate different classification systems.\\r\\n8  Conclusions\\r\\nIn this work we devised a threat analysis process to attempt\\r\\nto structure the work process of T1 SOC analysts. Our threat\\r\\nanalysis process consists of four stages where it guides the\\r\\nanalyst into collecting information relevant for their analysis.\\r\\nFurthermore, we conducted an experiment using real alert\\r\\ndata with ten T1 analysts working in a commercial SOC to\\r\\ninvestigate the effect of structuring the threat analysis pro-\\r\\ncess. Our results show that our process increases the odds\\r\\nof our subjects correctly classifying an alert by 167%. More\\r\\nspecifically, we observed that alerts correlated with a cyber\\r\\nattack are the alerts who significantly benefit from using our\\r\\nthreat analysis process.

Replicating the configuration used in the production\\r\\nenvironment of the SOC, a subset of rules was configured\\r\\nto not trigger alerts (i.e., starting points for analyst investiga-\\r\\ntions), but rather to generate logs stored in the SIEM. These\\r\\nlogs can be used by analysts to further enrich the context of\\r\\nthe events that triggered the investigated alert. These ‘muted’\\r\\nsignatures includehunting,policy, andinfo signatures.On\\r\\ntop of the alerts and network logs generated by the sensors,\\r\\nthe analysts were allowed to seek additional information from\\r\\nonline sources (e.g. to check file hashes, IP address reputation,\\r\\nperformwhoisqueries, ..) as normally performed during real\\r\\noperations.

We stress that the process does not\\r\\nmandate or instruct the analysts in how to find relevant infor-\\r\\nmation to make an assessment on that specific step (e.g. no\\r\\nquery template is provided to identify ‘related logs’,RL,in\\r\\ntheContextual informationstage). It is therefore to be\\r\\nexpected that, the wider the information space associated to\\r\\nthe assessment of a specific step is, the lower the expected\\r\\nagreement of analysts is. Our findings suggest that this holds\\r\\nalso for our pool of analysts who have similar background\\r\\nand level of experience, and who received the same profes-\\r\\nsional training. On the other hand, we observe that for each\\r\\nstage one or more steps consistently achieve relatively high\\r\\nagreement levels of 70% or more. To evaluate analysts agree-\\r\\nment on the outcome of the process, we calculate Cohen’s\\r\\nKappa on analysts’ final classification of an alert as ‘interest-\\r\\ning’ or ‘not interesting’ for those analysts who employed the\\r\\nproposed process (κ=0.52,CI:[0.36,0.68]), and those who\\r\\ndid not (κ=0.45,,CI:[0.28,0.64]). Whereas a straightfor-\\r\\nward interpretation ofκis not possible, both scores indicates a\\r\\n‘moderately strong agreement’ [1, Ch.11.5.4] within the two\\r\\ngroups. However, we do not find significant differences in the\\r\\nagreement levels between the two groups. This suggests that\\r\\nanalysts in either group take similar decisions when compared\\r\\nto analysts in the same group.\\r\\nEChanges to the process as a result of expert\\r\\nfeedback\\r\\nThe initial sequence steps identified was extended withCS\\r\\nafter the first round of verification, andRUCwas moved\\r\\nfrom the start of the sequence to the end.CSwas previously\\r\\ncovered byRUC, but was found to be atomic and impact-\\r\\nful enough to justify its own step. Additionally,CScan be\\r\\ndetermined more easily and thus earlier, thanRUC.\\r\\nAs discovered during the verification by the experts,RUC\\r\\nrequires details about the attack, the affected system and the\\r\\nimpact, which are not available early on in the analysis pro-\\r\\ncess.

INTRODUCTION \\r\\nIn   a   world   where   cyber   threats   are   rapidly   evolving, \\r\\norganizations  face  significant  challenges  in  protecting  their \\r\\ncritical data and resources [1]. \\r\\nA  Security  Operation  Center  (SOC)  is  a  critical  component \\r\\nwithin  any  organization,  providing  an  active  line  of  defense \\r\\nagainst cyberattacks and ensuring business continuity [2].  \\r\\nA  SOC  is  a  center  dedicated  to  monitoring,  analyzing  and \\r\\nmanaging  security  incidents  to  protect  an  organization  against \\r\\ncyber  threats  [3].  By  combining  advanced  technology,  well-\\r\\ndefined processes, and a  team  of  cybersecurity  experts, a  SOC \\r\\ncan  quickly  identify  and  respond  to  incidents  to  minimize  the \\r\\nimpact on the organization. \\r\\nThe advantages of implementing a SOC include: \\r\\na) Early detection of threats: A SOC can identify and assess \\r\\nthreats in real time, thus enabling rapid intervention to prevent \\r\\nor limit the impact on the organization. \\r\\nb)  Reducing  the  risk  of  data  breaches  -  through  constant \\r\\nmonitoring  and  analysis  of  activity,  a  SOC  helps  identify  and \\r\\nremediate  vulnerabilities,  thereby  protecting  the  organization's \\r\\nsensitive data. \\r\\nc)  Compliance  and  reporting  -  a  SOC  ensures  that  the \\r\\norganization   complies   with   cybersecurity   regulations   and \\r\\nrequirements, while facilitating effective reporting and auditing. \\r\\nd)  Improved  response  time  -  by  having  a  cyber-specialist,  a \\r\\ncybersecurity   team   and   advanced   technology,   a   SOC   can \\r\\nrespond quickly to the incident, reduce downtime and impact on \\r\\nthe organization's operations. \\r\\ne)   Increasing   security   awareness   among   employees   - \\r\\nimplementing  a  SOC  and  integrating  it  into  the  culture  of  the \\r\\norganization   helping   to   educate   employees   and   increase \\r\\nawareness of the importance of cyber security. \\r\\nAfter a brief introduction in SOC, Section II describes some \\r\\nopen-source tools for SOC that can be all included in one single \\r\\nplatform, Security  Onion.    Section    III    presents    SOC \\r\\nimplementation  based  on  a  distributed  architecture.  Section  IV \\r\\naims SOC as a service provided as a cybersecurity solution for \\r\\norganizations.   Finally,   conclusions   and   references   end   the \\r\\npaper. \\r\\n \\r\\nII. TOOLS FOR SOC \\r\\nImplementing  a  Security  Operation  Center  is  an  important \\r\\nstep  in  protecting  organizations  against  ever-evolving  cyber \\r\\nthreats.   By   combining   advanced   technology,   well-defined \\r\\nprocesses,  and  a  team  of  cybersecurity  specialists,  a  SOC  can \\r\\nprovide   a   high   level   of   security   and   resilience   for   any \\r\\norganization.   Ensuring   that   a   SOC   is   integrated   into   the \\r\\norganization's culture and promoting security awareness among \\r\\nemployees can significantly contribute to the long-term success \\r\\nand protection of an organization. However, the costs associated \\r\\nwith  implementing  a  traditional  SOC  can  be  prohibitive  for \\r\\nmany organizations. One solution to this problem can be the use \\r\\nof  high-quality  open-source  tools  that  allow  organizations  to \\r\\nbuild  their  own  SOC  at  a  fraction  of  the  cost  of  a  commercial \\r\\nsolution. \\r\\nWe can build an efficient and affordable SOC by combining \\r\\nthe following but not limited to open-source tools [4]: \\r\\na)   Suricata   -   a   high-performance,   open-source   network \\r\\nintrusion   detection   and   prevention   system   (NIDS/NIPS), \\r\\ncapable  of  analyzing  real-time  traffic  and  generating  alerts  for \\r\\nsuspicious activity. \\r\\nb) Zeek - an open-source tool for network metadata analysis \\r\\nthat provides a detailed view of network traffic, facilitating the \\r\\ndetection and investigation of security incidents. \\r\\nc) Stenographer - an open-source full packet capture solution \\r\\nthat  allows  the  recording  (storage)  and  subsequent  access  of \\r\\nnetwork  traffic  in  order  to  identify,  analyze  and  respond  to \\r\\ncyber security incidents. \\r\\nd) As Zeek and Suricata monitor network traffic, it is possible \\r\\nto extract files that are transferred over the network. These files \\r\\ncan  be  further  analyzed  with  the  Strelka  tool  that  scans  and \\r\\n979-8-3503-3798-3/23/$31.00 ©2023 IEEE539\\r\\n2023 27th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC) | 979-8-3503-3798-3/23/$31.00 ©2023 IEEE | DOI: 10.1109/ICSTCC59206.2023.10308432\\r\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember.

IMPLEMENTING A SOC \\r\\nSOC  implementation  can  use  various  architecture  principles \\r\\n[5].  \\r\\nIn   a   standard   distributed   deployment,   Security   Onion \\r\\ncomponents  are  installed  on  multiple  nodes  (a  Manager  Node, \\r\\none  or  more  Forward  Nodes,  and  one  or  more  Search  Nodes \\r\\nrespectively), each with specific roles.  \\r\\nA. Manager Node \\r\\nThis  node  is  responsible  for  coordinating  all  other  nodes  in \\r\\nthe  infrastructure.  It  hosts  core  services  such  as Elasticsearch, \\r\\nLogstash, Kibana, and Redis and manages system-wide security \\r\\npolicy and configuration. \\r\\nCurrently,      the      minimum      recommended      hardware \\r\\nconfiguration  for  this  type  of  node  is:  4-8  processor  cores,  16 \\r\\nGB of memory and 200 GB to 1 TB of disk space and can be \\r\\nvirtualized. \\r\\nThe  processor  will  be  used  mainly  to  take  incoming events \\r\\nand place them in Redis, run all front-end web components and \\r\\naggregate search results from the Search Node. \\r\\nRAM  will  be  used  for  Logstash  and  Redis,  the  amount  of \\r\\navailable  RAM  directly  influences  the  Redis  queue  size  and \\r\\noverall system performance. \\r\\nDisk  space  is  used  for  long-term  data  storage,  including  for \\r\\ngeneral  operating  system  purposes  and  for  storing  Kibana \\r\\ndashboards. \\r\\nB. Search Nodes \\r\\nThese  nodes  are  dedicated  to  process  Elasticsearch queries \\r\\nand  searches.  They  enable  horizontal  scaling  of  search  and \\r\\nstorage capacity, improving performance and reducing the time \\r\\nit takes to get results. The Search Node(s) consumes data from \\r\\nRedis, powered by the Manager Node. \\r\\nThe minimum hardware configuration recommended for this \\r\\ntype of node is: 4-8 processor cores, 16-64 GB of memory and \\r\\n200 GB or more disk space, depending on the desired retention \\r\\nperiod. \\r\\nThe processor analyzes and indexes the received events. \\r\\nThe  RAM  will  be  used  by  the  Logstash,  Elasticsearch,  and \\r\\ndisk  cache  components  for  Apache  Lucence  that  is  an  open-\\r\\nsource  software  library  written  in  Java  that  provides  advanced \\r\\ntext search and indexing functionality. The required amount of \\r\\nRAM  may  vary  depending  on  the  volume  of  data  and  the \\r\\ncomplexity  of  queries  and  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  search \\r\\nspeed and reliability. \\r\\nDisk space is used to store indexed metadata, a larger amount \\r\\nof  storage  space  allows  for  a  longer  retention  period.  It  is  not \\r\\nrecommended  to  keep  more  than  30  days  of  Elasticsearch \\r\\nindexes that contain recent data and are heavily used for queries \\r\\nand writes (hot indexes). \\r\\nC. Forward Node (Sensor) \\r\\nThe  forward  nodes  also  called sensors  are  responsible  for \\r\\ncapturing  network  traffic  and  generating  logs  from this  traffic. \\r\\nSensors  may  include  components  such  as  Meerkat,  Zeek,  and \\r\\nStenographer.  \\r\\nThese  nodes  send  the  captured  metadata  and  generated  logs \\r\\nto  the  Manager  Node  for  processing  and  storage.  The  PCAP \\r\\n(Packet Capture) files containing the network traffic capture are \\r\\nstored on this node and are accessed through an agent. \\r\\nThe  processor  analyzes  and  stores  network  traffic. Suricata \\r\\nand  Zeek  are  CPU  intensive  and  as  the  bandwidth  being \\r\\nmonitored  increases,  more  processing  power  is  required.

For example, if we want to \\r\\nuse  Suricata  for  NIDS  (Network  Intrusion  Detection System) \\r\\nalerts and Zeek for metadata, in the case of a saturated data link \\r\\nof 1 Gbps, we will need at least ten processor cores for Suricata \\r\\nand  Zeek  and  additionally  other  processor  cores  available  for \\r\\nStenographer  and  the  other  services.  If  the  available  resources \\r\\nare limited or a very large amount of traffic is monitored, for a \\r\\nmore  efficient  use  of  resources,  it  is  recommended to  use \\r\\nSuricata for both alerts and metadata. \\r\\nRAM  will  be  used  for  packet  processing  and  write  cache \\r\\n(temporary  data  storage  area  in  fast  memory,  used  to  optimize \\r\\nthe  speed  of  writing  data  to  a  storage  device).  The  amount  of \\r\\nRAM  required  depends  on  several  variables  such  as  active \\r\\nservices,  the  type  and  amount  of  monitored  traffic,  and  the \\r\\npercentage  of  packet  loss  accepted  in  the  organization.  If  we \\r\\ndeploy  in  production,  in a  large  network (1  Gbps  -10 Gbps), a \\r\\nsensor with all services - with Suricata for NIDS alerts, Zeek for \\r\\nmetadata  and  Stenographer  for  FPC  (Full  Packet  Capture),  an \\r\\nestimated  128  GB  up  to  256  GB  of  memory  is  required.  For \\r\\nhigher  performance,  we  recommend  an  additional  amount  of \\r\\nmemory and disabling swap. \\r\\nDisk  space  is  used  to  store  PCAP  files.  FPC-enabled  sensor \\r\\nnodes  require  a  lot of  storage  space.  A  larger  storage  size  will \\r\\nallow  for a longer retention period and the ability to have data \\r\\navailable  for  investigations  for  a  longer  period  of  time.  For \\r\\nexample,  if  a  data  connection  with  an  average  transfer  rate  of \\r\\n100 Mbps (12.5 MB/s) is monitored, it means that in one minute \\r\\n750  MB  are  stored  on  the  disk,  then  45  GB  in  one  hour, \\r\\nrespectively approximately 1 TB of data in 24 hours. \\r\\nD. Additional Nodes \\r\\nOther nodes with specific use can be implemented, such as: \\r\\n• Elastic Fleet Standalone Node  -  hosts the Elastic  Fleet \\r\\nservice  that  manages  the  Elastic  Agent  agents  on  the \\r\\nvarious terminals and devices in the network and allows \\r\\nthe   centralization   of   agent   management   and   the \\r\\napplication  of  security  policies.  It  is  necessary  that  all \\r\\nagents  connect to this  node,  in  order  not  to  expose  the \\r\\nother  nodes  to  analysis,  and,  therefore,  in  complex \\r\\ninfrastructures,    installing    it    in    the    DMZ    is \\r\\nrecommendable. \\r\\nIntrusion Detection Honeypot Node  -  hosts  honeypot \\r\\nServices   or   tokens   designed   to   attract   and   detect \\r\\nattackers; the data captured by the honeypots is sent to \\r\\nthe  Manager  Node  to  be  analyzed  and  generate  alerts \\r\\n \\r\\nFigure 1.

SECURITY OPERATION CENTER AS A SERVICE \\r\\nThere are many organizations that do not have the necessary \\r\\nresources  to  implement  their  own  SOC,  but  they  can adopt  an \\r\\noutsourced    solution    for    monitoring    and    managing    IT \\r\\ninfrastructure  security,  in  the  form  of  a  service: SOCaaS \\r\\n(Security Operation Center as a Service) (Fig. 2). \\r\\nSOCaaS  allows  organizations  to  benefit  from  the  expertise \\r\\nand  technologies  needed  to  protect  themselves  against  cyber \\r\\nthreats,  without  having  to  invest  their  own  resources  in  the \\r\\nanalysis  infrastructure  -  Manager,  Search  and  Elastic  Fleet \\r\\nStandalone  Node(s),  but  possibly  only  in  the  infrastructure  of \\r\\nacquisition of Sensor and Intrusion Detection Honeypot Node(s) \\r\\n[7].  \\r\\nSecurity  Service  Providers  can  set  up  IDH  nodes  as virtual \\r\\nmachines. By using the VXLAN tunneling protocol, they have \\r\\nthe capability to extend an organizational Layer 2 network over \\r\\nthe Internet and integrate the virtual IDH nodes in it. To ensure \\r\\ndata in transit is encrypted and authenticated, we encapsulate it \\r\\nin a Wireguard VPN tunnel, resulting a cost effective platform \\r\\nthat detects and analyzes cybersecurity threats [8]. \\r\\nWe  use  GNS3  Network  Emulator  to  simulate  and  test  this \\r\\ntype  of  platform  and  validate  our  approach  (Fig.  3). In  our \\r\\nimplementation,  we  use  MikroTik  routers  that  have  a  version \\r\\nintended to be used as a virtual machine instance.  \\r\\nIn order to keep the compatibility with older networks, in the \\r\\nSSP  network  we  create  VLANs  (one  for  each  connected \\r\\norganization) and place a virtual machine acting as IDH in each \\r\\nVLAN. \\r\\nPort  e0  in  SSP-SW  switch  configured  as  trunk  transports \\r\\nVLANs to the SSP-RTR router. \\r\\n  \\r\\n \\r\\nFigure 3.      The network simulated in GNS3. \\r\\nOn the SSP router, we configure one bridge interface for each \\r\\norganization,  and  add  the  corresponding  VXLAN  and  VLAN \\r\\ninterfaces as bridge ports. \\r\\nAfter   configuring   all   devices,   we   test   successfully   the \\r\\nconnectivity between IDHs and the organizations’ networks. \\r\\nThe  simulation  shows  that  this  security  approach  is  a  valid \\r\\nsolution  that  can  be  provided  to  various  organizations  by  the \\r\\nSSP.  This   solution   integrates   Security   Onion   as   an open \\r\\nplatform  into  SOCaaS  to  provide  a  complete  suite  of  tools  for \\r\\nmonitoring, analyzing and managing network and host security: \\r\\n• Security  Onion  Console  (Alerts,  Dashboards,  Hunt, \\r\\nCases, PCAP, Grid, Downloads, Admin) \\r\\n• Kibana \\r\\n• Elastic Fleet \\r\\n• Osquery Manager \\r\\n• InfluxDB \\r\\n• Playbook \\r\\n• ATT&CK Navigator. \\r\\nThe  Security  Onion  solution  integrates  these  tools into  a \\r\\nunified and flexible platform, offering significant advantages in \\r\\nterms    of    cost,    customization,    community    support    and \\r\\nscalability. \\r\\nV. CONCLUSIONS \\r\\nThis  paper  provides  a  brief  overview  of  the  benefits  and \\r\\nconsiderations  of  implementing  a  Security  Operation  Center \\r\\nwith open source components as a provided service (SOCaaS).  \\r\\nImplementing a Security Operation Center using open-source \\r\\ntools  can  provide  organizations  with  a  high  level  of  cyber \\r\\nsecurity  at  a  significantly  reduced  cost  compared  to  traditional \\r\\ncommercial solutions. By adopting an approach based on open-\\r\\nsource tools, organizations can build an efficient and affordable \\r\\nSOC   capable   of   meeting   the   ever-evolving   cybersecurity \\r\\nchallenges  but  they  also  can  use  SOCaaS  from  specialized \\r\\nproviders.   The   Security   Onion   case   study   highlights   the \\r\\neffectiveness  of  this  approach,  providing  valuable insights  for \\r\\norganizations  seeking  to  leverage  open  source  tools  for  their \\r\\nsecurity  operations.  We  can  use  this  approach  to  provide \\r\\nsecurely  other  domain  services  to  an  organization  over  the \\r\\npublic network. \\r\\nREFERENCES \\r\\n[1] C.  J.  Brooks,  C.  Grow,  P.  A.

Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized unit within an organization dedicated to monitoring, \\r\\ndetecting, responding to, and mitigating cybersecurity threats. Its primary objective is to safeguard the \\r\\norganization's information systems, networks, and data from a spectrum of cyber threats, including malware, \\r\\nphishing attacks, and unauthorized access. \\r\\n \\r\\nEquipped with advanced technologies and skilled cybersecurity professionals, a SOC continuously analyzes \\r\\nand correlates vast amounts of security data generated by network devices, applications, and endpoints. The \\r\\nSOC employs Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, intrusion detection systems, and \\r\\nother technologies to identify anomalies and potential security incidents. \\r\\n \\r\\nIn the event of a security incident, the SOC's expert analysts coordinate incident response efforts, employing \\r\\npredefined playbooks and response plans. The SOC's role extends beyond mere incident detection; it \\r\\nactively works to mitigate and remediate security threats, minimizing potential damage and ensuring the \\r\\norganization's resilience against cyberattacks. Regularly updating its methodologies, technologies, and \\r\\nresponse strategies, a SOC plays a pivotal role in maintaining a proactive and adaptive cybersecurity posture \\r\\nin the face of evolving cyber threats. \\r\\n \\r\\nSOC BENEFITS \\r\\n \\r\\nA Security Operations Center (SOC) is a critical component of modern cybersecurity strategies, playing a \\r\\npivotal role in safeguarding organizations against a myriad of cyber threats. Its importance is multifaceted, \\r\\naddressing the dynamic nature of the digital landscape and the evolving tactics employed by malicious \\r\\nactors. \\r\\n \\r\\nCentral to a SOC's significance is its ability to provide early threat detection. By continuously monitoring \\r\\nnetwork activities and leveraging advanced technologies such as Security Information and Event \\r\\nManagement (SIEM) systems, intrusion detection systems, and endpoint protection tools, a SOC can \\r\\nidentify anomalies and potential security incidents in real-time. This early detection is instrumental in \\r\\npreventing cyber threats from escalating into major breaches. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe SOC's capability for rapid incident response is equally crucial. In the event of a security incident, the \\r\\nSOC's dedicated incident response teams can execute predefined playbooks and response plans. This agility \\r\\nminimizes the impact of security breaches, mitigates risks swiftly, and prevents the spread of malicious \\r\\nactivities. Continuous monitoring is a cornerstone of a SOC's operation. This ensures vigilant oversight of an \\r\\norganization's digital assets, allowing security professionals to respond promptly to emerging threats, \\r\\nunauthorized access attempts, and abnormal activities within the network. Integration of threat intelligence \\r\\nfeeds enhances a SOC's proactive defense capabilities. By staying informed about the latest cyber threats \\r\\nand attack vectors, the SOC can adapt its security measures, fortifying the organization against evolving \\r\\nrisks. \\r\\n \\r\\nA SOC's efficient use of security technologies is instrumental in creating a layered defense mechanism. \\r\\nFrom SIEM systems that aggregate and analyze security data to intrusion detection systems that identify \\r\\nmalicious activities, these technologies work collaboratively to bolster the overall security posture of an \\r\\norganization. Beyond immediate incident response, a SOC conducts thorough incident investigations and \\r\\nforensic analyses. This post-incident analysis not only aids in understanding the root causes of security \\r\\nevents but also informs proactive measures to prevent similar occurrences in the future. A SOC's role \\r\\nextends to ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements. By adhering to specific \\r\\ncybersecurity standards, organizations can avoid legal and financial repercussions, fostering a secure and \\r\\ntrusted operational environment. \\r\\n \\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"8XNkYVoF4Aqj5obQpULmwLF9/PiY6HlzFyfUgjcInww=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf_8":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf_8\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":8,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\n 2 \\r\\nIn promoting operational resilience, a SOC minimizes downtime and disruptions caused by cyber incidents. \\r\\nRapid response and recovery strategies are essential for maintaining business continuity and preventing \\r\\nsignificant operational disruptions. Additionally, a SOC often plays a role in promoting cybersecurity \\r\\nawareness and training within organizations. Educating users about potential threats and best practices \\r\\nenhances the human element of cybersecurity, creating an additional layer of defense against social \\r\\nengineering attacks and other security threats. A well-functioning SOC is a cornerstone of an organization's \\r\\ncybersecurity strategy. Its continuous monitoring, early threat detection, rapid incident response, integration \\r\\nof threat intelligence, and contribution to compliance efforts collectively contribute to an organization's \\r\\nability to adapt, respond, and thrive in the face of an ever-evolving cyber threat landscape. \\r\\n \\r\\nTYPES OF SOCs \\r\\n \\r\\nOn-Prem \\r\\n \\r\\nAn on-premises Security Operations Center (SOC) refers to a cybersecurity facility physically located \\r\\nwithin an organization's premises, emphasizing a tangible, in-house approach to cybersecurity. In this \\r\\nmodel, the organization owns and manages the entire SOC infrastructure, including servers, network \\r\\ndevices, and security appliances. This on-prem SOC allows for direct control and customization of security \\r\\nmeasures, making it particularly suitable for industries with sensitive data and stringent compliance \\r\\nrequirements. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe physical presence of an on-prem SOC enhances network visibility, enabling security analysts to closely \\r\\nmonitor internal activities and respond promptly to security incidents. This model offers a higher degree of \\r\\ncustomization and integration with existing IT systems, aligning security measures more precisely with \\r\\norganizational goals. Additionally, the on-prem SOC provides a level of compliance control, facilitating \\r\\nadherence to industry standards and regulatory frameworks. While it offers benefits in terms of control and \\r\\ncustomization, organizations should weigh the associated challenges, including infrastructure costs and \\r\\nresource allocation, when opting for an on-prem SOC strategy. \\r\\n \\r\\nCloud SOC \\r\\n \\r\\nA Cloud Security Operations Center (SOC) is a cybersecurity model that operates in cloud environments, \\r\\noffering organizations the ability to monitor, detect, and respond to security threats within cloud-based \\r\\ninfrastructure. In contrast to traditional on-premises SOCs, a Cloud SOC is specifically designed to secure \\r\\nassets and data hosted in cloud platforms. \\r\\n \\r\\nKey features of a Cloud SOC include the ability to monitor virtual machines, containers, and cloud-native \\r\\nservices, providing comprehensive visibility into the dynamic and distributed nature of cloud environments. \\r\\nLeveraging cloud-native security technologies, such as Cloud Security Information and Event Management \\r\\n(Cloud SIEM) systems, a Cloud SOC is adept at handling the unique challenges posed by cloud platforms. \\r\\n \\r\\nCloud SOCs facilitate the centralization of security operations for organizations utilizing cloud services, \\r\\noffering advantages like scalability, flexibility, and the ability to adapt to the rapid pace of cloud technology \\r\\nevolution. This model allows businesses to harness the benefits of the cloud while ensuring that their digital \\r\\nassets are protected against a wide range of cyber threats. Security professionals in a Cloud SOC employ \\r\\ncloud-native tools and practices to proactively defend against emerging threats and safeguard critical data \\r\\nand applications in the cloud. \\r\\n \\r\\nM-SOC \\r\\n \\r\\nA Managed Security Operations Center (SOC) is a cybersecurity service model designed to enhance an \\r\\norganization's security posture by outsourcing the management of its security operations to a specialized \\r\\nprovider known as a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP). In this arrangement, the MSSP assumes \\r\\nthe responsibility of monitoring, detecting, and responding to security threats on behalf of the client \\r\\norganization. \\r\\n \\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"DVgW2CqXJRrzARIQVs498w69p/jzlxIt4rhyRhxVHkc=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf_9":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf_9\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\n 3 \\r\\nKey components of a Managed SOC include continuous monitoring of the organization's digital \\r\\ninfrastructure, proactive threat detection, and timely incident response. The MSSP employs advanced \\r\\ntechnologies, such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, intrusion detection \\r\\nsystems, and other cybersecurity tools, to analyze and correlate security data. This analysis is conducted by \\r\\nexperienced security analysts and experts who can interpret complex threat landscapes. \\r\\n \\r\\nManaged SOCs offer several advantages to organizations, particularly those with resource constraints or a \\r\\nneed for specialized cybersecurity expertise. One of the primary benefits is cost-effectiveness, as \\r\\noutsourcing security operations eliminates the need for significant upfront investments in technology, \\r\\ninfrastructure, and skilled personnel. This model allows organizations to leverage the MSSP's expertise, \\r\\nadvanced tools, and established processes without the burden of managing these aspects internally. \\r\\nMoreover, a Managed SOC provides scalability, allowing organizations to adjust their level of security \\r\\nservices based on their evolving needs. MSSPs are equipped to handle a wide range of security tasks, \\r\\nincluding incident response, vulnerability management, and compliance monitoring. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe MSSP's role extends beyond monitoring, encompassing incident response and mitigation. When a \\r\\nsecurity incident occurs, the Managed SOC initiates predefined response plans and coordinates with the \\r\\nclient to minimize the impact of the incident. This collaborative approach ensures a swift and effective \\r\\nresponse to security threats. A Managed SOC is a strategic cybersecurity partnership where organizations \\r\\nentrust the management of their security operations to external experts. This model provides a cost-effective, \\r\\nscalable, and expert-driven solution for organizations seeking to bolster their cybersecurity defenses while \\r\\nfocusing on their core business objectives. \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"X11FvvkjHGlxAg3SxqgituV/YcjcXCQLo3cbWahqyaw=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf_10":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf_10\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":10,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\n 4 \\r\\nPROCESS ASPECT \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nBy definition: process is a set of activities that transform inputs into outputs. This section explains which \\r\\nprocesses any SOC should establish to perform its duties. These processes are tightly integrated with the \\r\\ntechnologies and people, and require significant strategic planning. Selection of processes to be established \\r\\nis really what defines the SOC’s service portfolio. Without carefully crafting portfolio services, and thus \\r\\nprocesses, it is impossible to come up with the right investment plan for products and talent. \\r\\n \\r\\nFor the processes described below, corresponding NIST standards have been selected as reference. Also, the \\r\\ninherent need for creating policies and procedures, defining roles and responsibilities, and assigning \\r\\nemployees to the roles have been omitted for all the processes listed here. \\r\\n \\r\\nLOG MANAGEMENT \\r\\n \\r\\nLogs are like records of what happens in a company's computer systems, especially when it comes to \\r\\nsecurity. They're made by things like antivirus software, operating systems, and apps. But handling these \\r\\nlogs properly is a big task. Log management includes making, sending, storing, looking at, and getting rid of \\r\\nthese security logs. Regularly checking logs is important for catching security problems, rule-breaking, and \\r\\nother issues. It helps with audits, investigations, and compliance. This project uses NIST SP 800-92 Guide to \\r\\nComputer Security Log Management [1] document as a reference. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe challenge is dealing with lots of log sources, different content, formats, and too much data. It's tough \\r\\nbecause there's only so much we can do with limited resources. Managing logs also means keeping them \\r\\nsafe and making sure they're always available when needed. The guide for federal departments and agencies \\r\\ngives tips on how to handle these challenges. It probably suggests ways to use resources better, make log \\r\\nformats more consistent, and ensure that administrators regularly check logs properly.

Cryptographic keys are essential for safeguarding \\r\\nsensitive information and maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of data. The key management process \\r\\ninvolves various stages, each critical for maintaining a robust security posture. \\r\\n \\r\\n• Key Generation and Distribution: The key generation phase involves creating strong and random \\r\\ncryptographic keys that are resistant to attacks. This process often employs specialized algorithms \\r\\nand random number generators. Keys must be of sufficient length to resist brute-force attacks. Once \\r\\ngenerated, keys need to be securely distributed to authorized parties. This may involve using key \\r\\nexchange protocols, secure channels, or trusted key distribution centers. The challenge lies in \\r\\nensuring that keys are only accessible to authorized entities, minimizing the risk of interception or \\r\\ncompromise during distribution. Automated key distribution systems can enhance efficiency and \\r\\nreduce the risk associated with manual processes, ensuring that keys reach their intended recipients \\r\\nsecurely. \\r\\n• Key Storage and Lifecycle Management: Securing cryptographic keys throughout their lifecycle is \\r\\ncrucial to maintaining the overall security of cryptographic systems. Key storage mechanisms must \\r\\nbe resistant to both physical and digital attacks. Hardware security modules (HSMs) are often used \\r\\nto provide a secure environment for key storage, offering tamper-resistant hardware that safeguards \\r\\nkeys from unauthorized access. Additionally, effective key lifecycle management involves defining \\r\\npolicies for key rotation, expiration, and revocation. Regularly updating keys helps mitigate the risk \\r\\nassociated with compromised or outdated keys. Organizations must establish clear procedures for \\r\\nkey archival and recovery, ensuring that encrypted data can still be accessed in the event of key \\r\\nloss. Key management systems often include audit trails to track key usage and changes, aiding in \\r\\ncompliance efforts and facilitating the investigation of security incidents. \\r\\n• Key Deletion and Disposal: When cryptographic keys reach the end of their useful life or are \\r\\ncompromised, secure deletion and disposal processes are critical to prevent unauthorized access to \\r\\nsensitive information. Proper key disposal ensures that even if keys are recovered from storage \\r\\nmedia, they cannot be used to compromise encrypted data. Organizations must implement secure \\r\\nkey erasure mechanisms, often involving overwriting key material or rendering it irrecoverable. \\r\\nFurthermore, key disposal procedures should align with regulatory requirements and industry best \\r\\npractices. Regular audits and assessments of key management practices help identify vulnerabilities \\r\\nor deviations from security policies, enabling organizations to continuously improve their \\r\\ncryptographic key management processes and adapt to evolving threats. \\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"xTzHJK54Pvj/K/6gb2wmkum4Kg1FF6pqldZ8EpHmupE=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf_15":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf_15\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":15,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\n 9 \\r\\n \\r\\nIT CONTINGENCY PLANNING \\r\\n \\r\\nNIST Special Publication 800-34 [7] is a helpful guidebook, providing clear steps for preparing and \\r\\nresponding to unexpected events that could affect their computer systems.

It functions as a protective shield by monitoring and \\r\\ncontrolling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. The primary \\r\\npurpose of a firewall is to establish a barrier that prevents unauthorized access and protects the integrity and \\r\\nconfidentiality of the information within a network. \\r\\n \\r\\nFirewalls operate at the network level and, in some cases, at the application level, enforcing a set of \\r\\npredefined rules to filter and manage data packets. These rules dictate which traffic is allowed, denied, or \\r\\nflagged for further inspection. The two main types of firewalls are hardware firewalls, which are dedicated \\r\\nphysical devices, and software firewalls, which are software applications running on servers or network \\r\\ndevices. \\r\\n \\r\\nStateful inspection is a key feature of modern firewalls. It involves monitoring the state of active \\r\\nconnections and making decisions based on the context of the traffic. Unlike simple packet filtering, which \\r\\nevaluates each packet in isolation, stateful inspection considers the entire communication session. This \\r\\napproach enhances the firewall's ability to discern legitimate communication from potential security threats. \\r\\n \\r\\nFirewalls use a variety of methods to control and secure network traffic. Packet filtering examines data \\r\\npackets and makes decisions based on factors like source and destination addresses, port numbers, and the \\r\\nprotocol used. Proxy firewalls act as intermediaries between internal and external systems, forwarding \\r\\nrequests on behalf of clients to ensure that direct connections between the two are avoided. Network Address \\r\\nTranslation (NAT) is often used to mask internal IP addresses, enhancing privacy and security. \\r\\n \\r\\nApplication-layer firewalls, also known as proxy firewalls, operate at the application layer of the OSI model, \\r\\nproviding more granular control over specific applications or services.

These \\r\\nsystems play pivotal roles in proactively safeguarding digital assets, ensuring the integrity and \\r\\nconfidentiality of data, and mitigating the risks associated with cyberattacks. \\r\\n \\r\\nIntrusion Detection Systems (IDS): \\r\\n \\r\\nAn IDS is a monitoring tool that scrutinizes network and/or system activities to detect and alert on \\r\\nsuspicious or anomalous behavior. The primary objective is to identify potential security incidents by \\r\\nanalyzing patterns and deviations from established baselines. IDS operates in two main modes: signature-\\r\\nbased and anomaly-based detection. \\r\\n \\r\\n• Signature-Based Detection: This approach involves comparing observed activities against a \\r\\ndatabase of known attack signatures or patterns. If a match is found, the IDS raises an alert. \\r\\nSignature-based detection is effective against known threats but may struggle with new or \\r\\nsophisticated attacks that lack predefined signatures. \\r\\n \\r\\n• Anomaly-Based Detection: Anomaly-based IDS focuses on defining a baseline of normal network \\r\\nbehavior and alerting on deviations from that baseline. This method is more adept at detecting \\r\\nnovel or previously unseen attacks but may generate false positives if the baseline is not accurately \\r\\ncalibrated. \\r\\n \\r\\nIDS can be network-based, monitoring network traffic, or host-based, inspecting activities on individual \\r\\ndevices. Deployment of IDS contributes to early threat detection, aiding security teams in investigating and \\r\\nresponding to potential incidents promptly. However, IDS does not actively block or prevent malicious \\r\\nactivities; it solely serves to raise alarms for further investigation. \\r\\n \\r\\nIntrusion Prevention Systems (IPS): \\r\\n \\r\\nIPS, on the other hand, builds upon the capabilities of IDS by not only detecting but also actively preventing \\r\\nor blocking malicious activities. An IPS operates inline with network traffic and can take immediate action \\r\\nto thwart potential threats. It combines the detection mechanisms of IDS with the ability to enforce security \\r\\npolicies and respond in real-time. \\r\\n \\r\\n• Signature-Based Prevention: Similar to IDS, IPS utilizes signature-based detection to identify \\r\\nknown threats and employs predefined rules to block or allow traffic accordingly. This method is \\r\\neffective against recognized attack patterns but may be less adaptive to new or evolving threats. \\r\\n \\r\\n• Anomaly-Based Prevention: IPS may also incorporate anomaly-based detection to identify \\r\\ndeviations from normal behavior and block traffic that exhibits suspicious patterns. This helps in \\r\\npreventing previously unseen attacks but requires a robust baseline for accurate detection. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe integration of both IDS and IPS into a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy enhances an organization's \\r\\nability to detect and respond to security incidents. IDS provides early warning by identifying potential \\r\\nthreats, while IPS actively blocks or mitigates these threats in real-time. Together, they create a layered \\r\\ndefense mechanism, fortifying networks against a broad spectrum of cyber threats, including viruses, \\r\\nmalware, and various forms of cyberattacks. \\r\\n \\r\\nHowever, it's important to note that while these systems are powerful tools, they should be part of a broader \\r\\ncybersecurity framework that includes regular updates, threat intelligence, and other proactive measures to \\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"kebU5sdeuI6EI5tL3uPJuRYnq9s1z5daDiBnTOuTJ2Y=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf_24":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf_24\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":24,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\n 18 \\r\\nstay ahead of the evolving threat landscape.

EDR addresses this gap by providing advanced capabilities for \\r\\nmonitoring, analyzing, and responding to suspicious activities on endpoints. \\r\\n \\r\\nKey Components and Capabilities of EDR: \\r\\n \\r\\n• Continuous Monitoring: EDR solutions continually monitor endpoint activities in real-time. This \\r\\nincludes file and process executions, registry changes, network connections, and user behavior. The \\r\\nconstant surveillance allows for the early detection of anomalies and potential security incidents. \\r\\n• Behavioral Analysis: EDR employs behavioral analysis to establish a baseline of normal behavior \\r\\nfor each endpoint. Deviations from this baseline can be indicative of malicious activity. By \\r\\nunderstanding the typical actions of users and applications, EDR can identify anomalies that may \\r\\nsignify a security threat. \\r\\n• Threat Intelligence Integration: EDR systems are often integrated with threat intelligence feeds, \\r\\nincorporating up-to-date information about known malware, attack patterns, and indicators of \\r\\ncompromise.

A Security Operations Center (SOC) monitors a company’s digi-\\r\\ntal infrastructure to protect against these threats by detecting suspicious events and\\r\\ntaking mitigating action.  Adversaries commonly need to access resources illegiti-\\r\\nmately to achieve action upon their objectives, and do so via existing user accounts.\\r\\nWe develop a method to identify suspicious access behaviour using non-intrusive\\r\\ndata available to a SOC. For every user, a feature vector is constructed describing\\r\\ntheir access behaviour.  This vector contains statistics over a predefined period of\\r\\ntime onwhat resourcesa user accessed atwhat timeand inwhat manner. We sur-\\r\\nvey different Machine Learning profiling possibilities and select the general-purpose\\r\\nK-means clustering to group users with similar behavioural characteristics.\\r\\nWe apply this method to the Insider Threat logs from the Carnegie Mellon Uni-\\r\\nversity Software Engineering Institute, a synthetic dataset which is a benchmark for\\r\\ninsider threat detection research. Through access behaviour profiling, we were able\\r\\nto identify all users with the ITAdmin role.  The consistency of clusters for benign\\r\\nusers over time was compared and quantified through the Adjusted Rand metric.\\r\\nComparing consecutive months,  this resulted in an average consistency score of\\r\\n0.87.  We were able to detect 80% of insider threats with the ITAdmin role by moni-\\r\\ntoring for changes in their cluster over time.\\r\\nApplying the same methodology to access data of real-world organisations al-\\r\\nlows for significantly less consistent clustering, with average consecutive month con-\\r\\nsistency scores of 0.41. We observe a slight similarity between our clusters and the\\r\\ngroupings within the organisation’s Active Directory.  The clusters also show slight\\r\\nsimilarity with the groups inferred by Microsoft User Entity Behaviour and Analytics\\r\\nvia Machine Learning.  We show how the granularity of the most relevant features\\r\\nof the synthetic dataset differs from that of real-world data, which is suspected to\\r\\ncause this decrease in clustering consistency.\\r\\nTo  be  able  to  detect  suspicious  changes  in  user  access  behaviour  a  consis-\\r\\ntent profiling method is required.  Our privacy-preserving, general-purpose profiling\\r\\nmethodology enabled consistent results on the synthetic dataset.

organisations, and using account privi-\\r\\nleges to access digital resources illegitimately is a part of almost every successful\\r\\ncyber attack. This research creates a method to profile users based on their access\\r\\nbehaviour using the data from a Security Operations Center (SOC). Having accu-\\r\\nrate user access profiles allows for detecting suspicious deviations in this behaviour,\\r\\nwhich  can  be  used  to  alert  a  SOC  analyst  to  take  a  closer  look  at  an  account’s\\r\\nactivity and determine whether the accesses could be malicious.\\r\\nOne of the good practices regarding cyber security is the least privilege principle.\\r\\nIf a user does not need to access a particular resource for their regular responsibil-\\r\\nities, their account should not have access to this resource.  This is an example of\\r\\naccess control, which takes effort to keep track of and maintain over time. For exam-\\r\\nple, if someone leaves a the company, their accesses should be revoked. In reality,\\r\\nthis is often not done correctly [1], causing accounts to have more privileges than\\r\\nrequired.  This becomes a problem when an adversary manages to gain control of\\r\\nthis account, known as account compromise, or when a user turns against their em-\\r\\nployer, called an insider threat.  If a domain admin account gets compromised with\\r\\nall the access rights they possess, it will pose a security risk even when adhering\\r\\nto the least privilege principle.  Therefore it is crucial to not only survey the access\\r\\ncontrol policies but also consider the actual accesses an account performs to detect\\r\\nsuspicious activity, which is where a SOC comes into play.\\r\\nThe goal of a SOC is to detect suspicious events within an organisation’s digital\\r\\ninfrastructure.   Multiple data sources can be used for detection,  such as sensors\\r\\nwithin the network to capture traffic, logs of servers and logs of end-point devices. A\\r\\nSecurity Information and Event Management system (SIEM) is used to combine and\\r\\ncorrelate this data. Using this SIEM, a SOC looks for suspicious events such as an\\r\\naccount being granted admin privileges or a user visiting a possible phishing web-\\r\\nsite.  Not every detection implies a security risk.  Actions labelled as suspicious can\\r\\nhave been performed legitimately, or the detection rule can be faulty.

INTRODUCTION\\r\\ndetection causes manual labour for an analyst to verify the detection’s legitimacy, it\\r\\nis a SOC’s goal to finetune its detection rules.  The detections should trigger on as\\r\\nmany security risks as possible, this is called a True Positive. The other possibilities\\r\\ninclude events without actual risk, called False Positives, from which we want as few\\r\\nas possible. Additionally, the rate of actual security threats going undetected, called\\r\\nFalse Negatives, should naturally be as close to zero as possible.\\r\\nThe digital infrastructure of an organisation usually contains ‘crown jewels’, which\\r\\nare  their  most  valuable  assets.   These  can  be  on-premise  servers  such  as  file\\r\\nservers, Domain Controllers (DCs) and mail exchange servers. DCs host a domain’s\\r\\nActive Directory (AD), which imposes user and device policies. A compromise of the\\r\\nDC can lead to malicious policies being executed on all of an organisation’s domain-\\r\\njoined devices, such as employee laptops.  A file server usually contains much of\\r\\nan organisation’s confidential data, which should only be accessed by those with a\\r\\nlegitimate reason.  Because we use access as an indicator for potentially malicious\\r\\nbehaviour,  these resource types are our main points of focus.   The input data in\\r\\nthis research is limited to access events within the Windows Event log to remain\\r\\nas little invasive on user’s behavioural data as possible, whilst being able to make\\r\\ninferences on suspicious accounts.   When behavioural monitoring raises an alert\\r\\nfor the SOC, the alert needs to clarifywhya certain user account was marked as\\r\\nsuspicious to assist the analyst in their further investigation.  This reasoning is also\\r\\na requirement from ethical perspective,  as it is impermissible to have an opaque\\r\\nalgorithm labelling users for suspicion. This process needs to be as transparent and\\r\\nexplainable as possible.\\r\\nDetection rules within a SIEM describe when to raise an alert, based on log en-\\r\\ntries.  An alert is a suspicious activity that a SOC analyst looks into to determine\\r\\nits legitimacy and takes action upon if it is suspected to be malicious.  Frequently,\\r\\nsuch rules are static in determining suspicious events. However, this poses a prob-\\r\\nlem when creating a profile based on behaviour, as this is a dynamic characteristic.\\r\\nTherefore, this research aims to develop a novel methodology using existing meth-\\r\\nods to create user behavioural profiles from access logs and be able to detect sus-\\r\\npicious deviations from this profile over time, by using non-invasive data available to\\r\\na SOC.\\r\\nThis research is conducted at the Northwave1SOC, which has a number of cus-\\r\\ntomers to which they provide Detection and Response services. Our novel profiling\\r\\nmethodology constructed through literature research is first tested on a synthetic\\r\\ndataset. The dataset, called ’Insider Threat v4.2’ [2], contains computer logs on be-\\r\\nnign and malicious users and was created by the Computer Emergency Response\\r\\nTeam (CERT) division of Carnegie Mellon University.

Finally, we highlight the Data Science fundamentals re-\\r\\nquired to understand the methodology of this research.\\r\\n2.1    SOC Access Data\\r\\nA SOC has several methods of monitoring digital infrastructure.  By inserting sen-\\r\\nsors  into  the  network,  traffic  can  be  captured  to  detect  which  hosts  interact  with\\r\\neach other and possibly inspect the payload.  Server logs are very useful, as these\\r\\nare central parts of the infrastructure with which many users directly or indirectly\\r\\ninteract.  Organisations generally use a domain to manage their devices.  A domain\\r\\nis a group of computers within a network administered by a central server, the Do-\\r\\nmain Controller (DC). Accounts within the domain can log onto every device they are\\r\\nauthorised to, using their domain account and password. Domain accounts authen-\\r\\nticate against the DC to log onto such devices and resources.  There are multiple\\r\\ntypes of authentication, which are some of the events the SOC can monitor to de-\\r\\ntermine a user’s access behaviour.  In addition to servers and networks, endpoint\\r\\ndevices such as employee laptops or phones can be monitored, as these types of\\r\\ndevices can provide access to company resources.\\r\\nEach of the above-mentioned devices generates logs. To correlate these different\\r\\ndata sources and analyse them, logs are sent to a Security Information and Event\\r\\nManagement (SIEM) system.  The SIEM solution used for the real-world scenario\\r\\npart of this research is Sentinel1, a cloud service by Microsoft.

BACKGROUND\\r\\nsend a subset of their Windows Events logs2  3to this SIEM for analysis.\\r\\nTo access a resource, a user must first authenticate to prove they are authorised.\\r\\nIn the Windows domain this is commonly performed via the default protocol Kerberos\\r\\n[3], which uses tickets distributed by the DC, or the fall-back NTLM4, a challenge-\\r\\nresponse mechanism. When a user accesses a resource after valid authentication,\\r\\nWindows Event 4624 is logged:An account was successfully logged on. This event\\r\\ncontains, amongst others, information on the time, user, target host, authentication\\r\\ntype, connection method and source IP. If a user logs off, this generates events 4634\\r\\nor 4647, which include similar information.\\r\\n2.2    Microsoft Sentinel\\r\\nThe  real-world  data  part  of  this  research  is  performed  using  the  Microsoft  Sen-\\r\\ntinel SIEM5. Sentinel is a cloud solution that,  among others,  can be used to in-\\r\\ngest logs from endpoint devices.   The data is saved in tables and queried using\\r\\nthe Kusto  Query Language (KQL).  The tables  used for this  research include the\\r\\nSecurityEventtable, which contains the ingested Windows Events.  Azure Active\\r\\nDirectory (AAD) is an identity and access management tool organisations can use\\r\\nto sign into apps using Single Sign-On (SSO). Suppose the on-premise AD is syn-\\r\\nchronised with the Azure Active Directory.  In that case, it is possible to correlate\\r\\nthe on-premise accounts with cloud accounts and perform further analyses using\\r\\nUser and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA)6. This produces two additional tables:\\r\\nIdentityInfoandUserPeerAnalytics.  IdentityInfo displays a combination of on-\\r\\npremise and cloud properties of an account.  UserPeerAnalytics provides a list of\\r\\nup to 20 ranked peers for any AAD account, generated using Microsoft’s machine-\\r\\nlearning algorithm applied to all of its connected data sources. Since the peer ana-\\r\\nlytics table is based on cloud accounts and our analysis is performed by monitoring\\r\\non-premise accesses, the accounts need to be correlated using the IdentityInfo table\\r\\nas shown in Figure 2.1.\\r\\n2Windows      Event      list:https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/\\r\\nencyclopedia/\\r\\n3Windows  Events  sent  to  a  SIEM:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/\\r\\nwindows-security-event-id-reference\\r\\n4NTLM:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/secauthn/microsoft-ntlm\\r\\n5Microsoft Sentinel:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/overview\\r\\n6Sentinel UEBA:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ueba-reference\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"uSCLiVs8JdnBpq6W5dQJP2LyCAgRDvmonKC2RyTNyMQ=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_13":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_13\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\n2.3.

The way we\\r\\napply these methods are further discussed in the methodology section.\\r\\nK-means clustering\\r\\nThis  section  describes  the  clustering  approach,  a  choice  which  is  further  moti-\\r\\nvated in Section 3.5. There are different possibilities for clustering points in a multi-\\r\\ndimensional area. In our case of user clustering, every point represents a user and\\r\\na  feature  vector  is  a  list  of  numerical  properties  describing  the  user’s  behaviour.\\r\\nEvery feature within a user’s feature vector is translated to a dimension within the\\r\\nmultidimensional area.  K-Means aims to partition objects in this multi-dimensional\\r\\nspace intonclusters.   This is achieved by minimising the ’Within-Cluster Sum of\\r\\nSquares’ and maximising the ’Between-Cluster Sum of Squares’.The naive version\\r\\nof the algorithm uses the following steps, which are further illustrated by Figure 2.2:\\r\\n•Step 1:Initialisationselectnrandom points in multi-dimensional space to be\\r\\nthe initial ’centroid’\\r\\n•Step 2:InitialisationAssociate each point to its closest ’centroid’\\r\\n•Step 3:Compute the gravitational centre, the centroid, for each label\\r\\n•Step 4:Associate each point with their closest centroid\\r\\n•Step 5:Repeat from step 3 until convergence, or halt if the centroids do not\\r\\nmove anymore.\\r\\nThe parameter provided to the K-Means clustering algorithm is the number of\\r\\nclusters, which influences every of the clustering steps.  An extra centroid means\\r\\nthat the results of steps 3 and 4 of the algorithm will be different. Additionally, there is\\r\\na factor of chance in the algorithm. Picking the initial centroid points is performed at\\r\\nrandom, so selecting different points could cause the centroids to travel in a different\\r\\ndirection.  Hence it is essential to reproducibility to seed the randomness so that,\\r\\ngiven the same data,  the algorithm will result in the same clusters when applied\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"BfJWzk3TLMfHiKj+IuQQV96gKbP+i1FeY/Em8t/tksM=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_14":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_14\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":14,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\n8                                                                                                  CHAPTER2.

For this, we compare how users are divided amongst the clusters for different\\r\\niterations of the algorithm.  This is not as trivial as counting the number of users\\r\\nclassified into different clusters, as the number of users designated to a cluster can\\r\\nchange.   For  this,  we  apply  the  adjusted  Rand  index7,  a  function  measuring  the\\r\\nsimilarity of two separate cluster divisions.  This metric was initially developed by\\r\\nRand [4], but because of the underlying formula, it often returns a value close to 1\\r\\nwhen comparing different sets of labels. The Rand index method was later optimised\\r\\nby Hubert et al. [5] to compensate for this factor of chance.

Finally, we visit the work benchmarking their anomaly detection algorithms on\\r\\nthe synthetic CERT Insider Threat dataset.\\r\\n3.1    Access Control\\r\\nFor a user account to access a resource, they require the appropriate permissions.\\r\\nWithin an organisation’s digital infrastructure, this is usually arranged via Active Di-\\r\\nrectory groups. A group can be granted read and write rights to a resource. If a user\\r\\nis a member of this group, they inherit all these rights.  Managing such accesses\\r\\nfor users and groups is calledAccess control.  The Principle of Least Privilege is\\r\\na concept within information security which describes that users should only have\\r\\naccess to the resources they need.  Not adhering to this principle forms a security\\r\\nrisk if an adversary manages to control an account, such as in the case of account\\r\\ncompromise or insider threats.\\r\\nResearch has tried to detect misconfigurations in such policies using different\\r\\napproaches. Das et al. [6] created Baaz: a tool that represents access control poli-\\r\\ncies  as  a  matrix,  which  for  every  user  (column)  and  every  resource  (row)  states\\r\\nwhether access is granted.  If a reference dataset exists on which resources every\\r\\nrole should be able to access,  users can be mapped to a role group with similar\\r\\nrights.   The resources that share the same policies are clustered if no reference\\r\\nmatrix is available.  From this, clusters of users with roughly the same access per-\\r\\nmissions can be produced. After the clustering step, users and resources which do\\r\\nnot fit into any cluster are marked as outliers.  In this case,  anOutliercan imply\\r\\nusers with too many permissions, a security issue, and users who have too few per-\\r\\n11\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"N6M+tpxl8bRvQFuyyMX2djgSEsPodEMboCHMvVvo2YA=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_18":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_18\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":18,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\n12                                                                                             CHAPTER3.

The detection of accessibility issues is, to us, not\\r\\na goal in itself, but repeated access requests through misconfigurations could lead\\r\\nto  administrators  becoming  too  generous  in  granting  access  permissions,  hence\\r\\nleading to security issues again.  In reality,  such well-documented access control\\r\\nmatrices or even a reference dataset on roles and resources are often not available.\\r\\nTherefore is more realistic to perform analyses on logs.  Bauer et al. [7] performed\\r\\nlog analysis to analyse the access attempts foraccessibilityproblems.  They used\\r\\nassociation rule mining [8], a type of inference that tries to predict future accesses\\r\\nthrough previous ones. Because such rules can repeatedly produce the same false\\r\\nassociation, a feedback mechanism was introduced to prevent these mistakes from\\r\\nreoccurring. However, since such labelling is performed manually, when applied on\\r\\na larger scale it becomes labour-intensive, which is undesirable to a SOC.\\r\\n3.2    Relational database user profiling through access\\r\\nlogs\\r\\nOne of the goals of profiling users through access logs is to detect deviations from\\r\\nthe norm.  This is a use case foranomaly detection, for example, when someone\\r\\nsuddenly changes behaviour to access more resources than usual or logs in outside\\r\\nof office hours.\\r\\nThe research area of user profiling and anomaly detection using logs is more\\r\\nmature within the field of relational databases.  Even though this is a specific type\\r\\nof resource access, their methodologies are still relevant when considering broader\\r\\nresource types.  Kamra et al. [9] mined SQL queries from the database audit logs,\\r\\ncreating profiles to model normal database access behaviour. These profiles consist\\r\\nofquiplets, extracting different fields from the SQL query to determine what data is\\r\\nqueried, such as tables, columns and constraints. To train their model, outliers were\\r\\nremoved,  under the assumption that the leftover queries were benign.  Similar to\\r\\nBauer [7], they used two scenarios:  role-based and unsupervised.  For the former,\\r\\nthe role was available for every user executing query, and the Naive Bayes Clas-\\r\\nsifier1was used to produce the probability that a user with this role would indeed\\r\\nexecute such a query.  The unsupervised scenario is approached as a clustering\\r\\nproblem. Every user is mapped onto a cluster, and whenever a new query is issued,\\r\\ntheir model tests whether it is likely that the authenticating account issued this query.\\r\\nBoth the Naive Bayes method and a statistical test are used to determine outliers.\\r\\nBertino et al.

They used the Naive Bayes\\r\\nClassifier, trained through supervised learning using synthetic and real-world data.\\r\\nEvery query included role data, and the classifier computed the probability that this\\r\\nrole would execute a query with these properties.  The testing was performed by\\r\\naltering the role of the query and verifying whether it was marked as an anomaly.\\r\\nIn addition to verifying the precision and recall of their triplets with different amounts\\r\\nof training tuples, the researchers calculated the influence of the number of roles\\r\\nand  database  attributes  for  this  classification.   Discovering  the  proper  number  of\\r\\nroles for access control within an organisation is very useful to identify accessibility\\r\\nand security issues, such as Bauer [7] aimed to identify. A query within a relational\\r\\ndatabase shares similarities to logon actions within an organisational domain be-\\r\\ncause it is a user action connecting to a resource through characterizing features.\\r\\nThe  target  table,  parameters,  and  query  conditions  make  up  the  access  proper-\\r\\nties for SQL queries.  A user connecting to a resource also has a destination host,\\r\\nand properties could be the connection or authentication method.  Converting such\\r\\ninformation into a quiplet is essentially a feature vector fed into the ML (Machine\\r\\nLearning) algorithm.  As they were able to cluster users based on such information\\r\\nand verify whether every new query falls within the cluster of the authenticated user\\r\\nis a favourable outcome for our proposed method.\\r\\n3.3    Anomaly detection through user action monitor-\\r\\ning\\r\\nThis literature research aims to find the best method for detecting access (attempts)\\r\\nthat deviate from normal behaviour since this can indicate an insider threat or com-\\r\\npromised account.

While the system learns\\r\\nthe user’s behaviour, it reaches an equilibrium where rarely any new anomalies are\\r\\ndetected after a while. The research compares the different monitoring elements by\\r\\nplacing a different person than the authenticated account in front of the computer,\\r\\nhaving them perform exercises and testing how long it takes for every element to\\r\\nmark the user’s behaviour as anomalous. The keystrokes and viewed sites features\\r\\nrecognised anomalous behaviour the quickest, but a weighted combination of all fea-\\r\\ntures performed the best.  For access behaviour, a similar approach could be used\\r\\nby converting every feature into a numerical value, giving weight to every feature,\\r\\nand testing against the historical profile whether there is a statistical difference.  If\\r\\nthere is a difference, its weight score gets added to the cumulative anomaly score\\r\\nevery interval. The session is marked as anomalous if the anomaly score crosses a\\r\\nthreshold.\\r\\nWang et al. [12] analysed user behaviour through characteristics similar to those\\r\\nused  by  Pannell  [11].   As  they  only  test  on  labelled  datasets,  a  supervised  ML\\r\\napproach is possible through the use of Support Vector Machines.  Their dataset\\r\\nincludes biometric information, and they found that this characteristic worked well\\r\\nin profiling the correct individual and identifying whether the authenticated account\\r\\nbelongs to the user behind the computer interactions.  However, their testing setup\\r\\nallows for making assumptions on legitimate training data without anomalies and re-\\r\\nquires detailed datasets on user-computer interactions. Thus, the nature of this data\\r\\nand training assumptions make it infeasible to apply their method within a SOC.\\r\\nWhen teaching an algorithm to distinguish between different users in audit sessions,\\r\\nif users share many behavioural traits, this causes many false positives. This issue\\r\\nwas recognised by Garchery et al. [13], who went on to group similar individual users\\r\\ninto clusters and found this led to better overall performance. Their approach to user\\r\\nrepresentation and clustering is confusion matrices with actual and predicted users\\r\\non the different axes. The main difference with regular unsupervised anomaly detec-\\r\\ntion is that they start with a supervised dataset with identified user sessions. It is then\\r\\nconverted into an unsupervised method through the clustering of similar-behaving\\r\\nusers. Their identification of users is performed through similar information per ses-\\r\\nsion as other IDS mechanisms like Pannell’s research [11] did, e.g. authentications,\\r\\nIP address- and temporal features.  This methodology worked well for masquerade\\r\\ndetection:  when a user logs in via someone else’s credentials.  Therefore, it could\\r\\npossibly also detect when a regular user suddenly acts like an administrator.  The\\r\\nfeatures used are not solely access-focused,  but they use features available to a\\r\\nSOC, such as destination host and temporal login features.

[14] converted the behaviour of employees into ten boolean variables\\r\\nto turn into a feature vector. They used Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to detect\\r\\nanomalies with the ability to involve non-technical indicators in the form of sensitivity\\r\\nprofiles: certain situations can cause parameters to become more significant, such\\r\\nas financial problems for an individual causing to become more sensitive to financial\\r\\nfraud. GMMs allow for a mixture of probability distributions, which is helpful for mon-\\r\\nitoring behaviour as this can change slowly over time. Their solution has a feedback\\r\\nloop through analysts to improve detection, as the analysts’ input is a labelled obser-\\r\\nvation. A GMM per employee is created, and the decision-making process is visually\\r\\nrepresented to get insight into which factors lead to the detection of the anomaly be-\\r\\ning triggered.  Role information can also be included, as different roles may have\\r\\ndifferent suspicious behaviour, such as the sales department mailing many files to\\r\\npeople outside the company.  Although quite useful, their approach with the sensi-\\r\\ntivity profiles is very intrusive, so generally not applicable within a SOC. The analyst\\r\\nfeedback loop could work well in practice to reduce false positives,  although this\\r\\nwould require significant manual labour.  Their ML is unsupervised and can include\\r\\nrole information, so it could be helpful for comparing the user themselves to the rest\\r\\nof their role group.\\r\\nIn addition to ML, statistical analyses can be used for anomalous insider detection.\\r\\nChen  et  al.  [15]  developed  a  methodology  called  Community  Anomaly  Detection\\r\\nSystem (CADS). They take the set of User-Resource pairings and form communi-\\r\\nties through this, visualised in a 2D grid with one node per user.  Through several\\r\\nformulas, the distance of every user to the nearest community is calculated.  If this\\r\\ndistance crosses a threshold, the access behaviour is considered anomalous.  The\\r\\ndomain of CADS is Electronic Health Registries (EHR). As there are likely to be\\r\\nmore unique EHR patient files than users in the system,  this type of comparison\\r\\nlikely does not hold within an organisation’s digital infrastructure,  as there will be\\r\\nfewer servers than users accessing them, reducing the granularity of user profiles.\\r\\nChen et al.  also introduce MetaCADS, which additionally considers the subject of\\r\\nthe accessed files, such as the medical department.  This improved the communi-\\r\\nties and detected outliers, but requires additional domain knowledge beforehand to\\r\\ncategorise resources, so its SOC applicability would depend on the availability of\\r\\ninformation regarding groups of resources.\\r\\nGates et al.

Another\\r\\nexample is the shortest path between two URLs:  how many hyperlinks it takes to\\r\\nget from one internet page to the other. The core of this detection mechanism is that\\r\\nthere needs to be a numerical distance to express similarity between two accesses,\\r\\nwhich is hard to apply within our access type without significant domain knowledge\\r\\nof the network and occupations. This approach is likely not suitable for our research.\\r\\nWe have seen so far that related work can perform proper detection of malicious\\r\\nactivity on user accounts, but mainly by profiling the user interaction with the com-\\r\\nputer itself, contrary to just the access properties.  This leads to substantial feature\\r\\nvectors per person fed into an ML algorithm, which can perform well.  Such experi-\\r\\nments were, however, mostly performed in an experimental setting with intensively\\r\\nmonitored test subjects.   This,  in practice,  is undesirable,  if not impossible,  for a\\r\\nSOC. Additionally,  as every experiment was conducted in a different setting,  it is\\r\\nhard to compare the results to conclude which approach works best.  This problem\\r\\nis solved by having a standardised test dataset, which we highlight next.\\r\\n3.4    CERT Insider Threat dataset\\r\\nThe CERT Insider Threat Dataset [17] was designed by B. Lindauer from Carnegie\\r\\nMellon University, containing multiple synthetic log files and user properties of an\\r\\nimaginary organisation.  The dataset consists of files regarding different aspects of\\r\\na user’s digital behaviour, as well as organisational data such as users’ roles and\\r\\nteams and their personality traits. This dataset spans two years and contains differ-\\r\\nent types of insider threat scenarios.  A subset of users performs malicious actions\\r\\nsomewhere in the course of the two years, in which actions are properly labelled.\\r\\nThis makes it very useful for benchmarking insider threat detection algorithms, which\\r\\nit is often used for in related work.\\r\\nAn unsupervised user behaviour modelling approach for anomaly detection was\\r\\ndeveloped  by  Sharma  et  al.

An auto-\\r\\nencoder is a neural network model which tries to recreate its input in a compressed\\r\\nmanner.

These\\r\\nactions are kept track of within both static time windows and user sessions to com-\\r\\npare performance. They used the CERT v4.2 dataset to benchmark their approach.\\r\\nSharma recognises that it is harder to find a trade-off between false positives and\\r\\nmissing anomalies when using fixed time windows to extract features.  It is hard to\\r\\ndetect an anomaly for short windows, whilst for large windows, the behaviour could\\r\\nbecome too generic.  Therefore, the model takes all events within one session as\\r\\nfeature vector input, which comprises 44 features.  These events include numerical\\r\\nfeatures such as to how many devices a connection was made or how many job\\r\\nsearching websites were visited and categorical features such as the role or func-\\r\\ntional unit. All numbers are normalised to a range of (0,1). Sharma et al. found that\\r\\noff-hour activity is critical information, just as whether usage is from a user’s regular\\r\\npc. Their feature vectors are chronologically divided into training, validation and test-\\r\\ning.  Unsupervised LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks [20] are used to prepare the\\r\\nmodel as this allows for temporal analysis when one action depends on the other.\\r\\nIn this LSTM network, the session is anomalous if a reconstruction error is larger\\r\\nthan the threshold computer during the learning phase. After 95 sessions per user,\\r\\nthey could predict with over 90% accuracy whether a session was anomalous. Their\\r\\ntype of data used is similar to SOC access data, so LSTM auto-encoders have the\\r\\npotential for discovering insider threats from a SOC standpoint.\\r\\nTuor et al.  applied deep learning to identify insider threats in an unsupervised\\r\\nmanner [21],  through,  amongst others,  LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks.  Using\\r\\nboth categorical (e.g.   role,  supervisor) user attributes and continuous count fea-\\r\\ntures tracking 408 different activities in a 24h time window, they mark a user’s day\\r\\nas regular or anomalous. They found that the LSTM model is quite capable of gen-\\r\\neralising. Moreover, keeping track of the sequence of actions in its hidden memory\\r\\nsaves the analyst’s time for creating aggregate count-style features that related re-\\r\\nsearch has attempted and can be applied to single log entries.\\r\\nLe et al.  performed multiple types of research on the CERT dataset.  In one pa-\\r\\nper [22], they recognise the problem of scarcity of labelled data to make decisions\\r\\non. They developed a user-centred insider threat detection system, focusing on dif-\\r\\nferent data granularity levels.  Their feature vectors consist of the user actions from\\r\\na week, day, session or sub-session, generating vectors with 200 to 1100 features,\\r\\nand the number of vectors is respectively 4.000.000 to 100.000. Focusing on the se-\\r\\ncurity analyst’s perspective to provide them with clear information makes it similar to\\r\\nour SOC-based approach.

RELATEDWORK\\r\\nAs the CERT dataset includes different malicious scenarios, Le also tested which\\r\\napproaches work best for what type of scenario.  They performed classification of\\r\\nboth instances (one log entry or feature vector) and users (whether an employee\\r\\nturned malicious at some point). From these two, the user-based detection resulted\\r\\nin  the  highest  precision  rates.   Additionally,  for  the  RF  classifier,  they  performed\\r\\nfeature analysis based on Gini impurity.  This is used to infer how important every\\r\\nfeature within the vector is for the ML algorithm.  Realising this effectivity per type\\r\\nof threat scenario and the importance of different features is very useful to realise\\r\\nwhat input data is relevant and what types of threats still go undetected.  After ap-\\r\\nplying supervised ML approaches,  the same authors performed an unsupervised\\r\\nlearning-based anomaly detection approach for insider threat detection [23].  They\\r\\napplied four methods: Auto-encoders, Isolation Forest, Lightweight On-line detection\\r\\nof anomalies, and Local Outlier Factor.  Additionally, they varied the representation\\r\\nof temporal information within data, optimising how behavioural changes over time\\r\\nare detected. Variations include concatenating feature vectors from a specific time-\\r\\nframe, explicitly adding the percentile, or the difference between a number and its\\r\\nmean or median, to the feature vector.  Every CERT version dataset has a differ-\\r\\nent organisational structure and scenarios.  They looked into their model’s generic\\r\\napplicability and robustness for different datasets by training on one CERT dataset\\r\\nversion and applying it to another.  Finally, applying multiple algorithms allows vot-\\r\\ning:  An event is only marked as anomalous if the number of algorithms marking it\\r\\nanomalous crosses a threshold.  Combining the knowledge this way improved their\\r\\napproach’s detection ability and robustness.

Pannell et al.  keep track of a user by counting specific actions, also referred\\r\\nto asfrequency feature,  over a session of 30 seconds,  such as keystroke analy-\\r\\nsis and the amount of running applications.  For access behaviour, other elements\\r\\ncould be kept track of and counted in a time interval, such as the different destination\\r\\nhosts, authentication methods and logon types. Sharma et al. used a session-based\\r\\napproach instead of a predefined timeframe.  They kept track of, amongst others,\\r\\nwhether a logon was during working hours, the day of the week and the logon until\\r\\nlogoff session duration. User activities were tracked by Tuor et al. by counting them\\r\\nin a 24-hour time window. For every action taken by the user a value was increased,\\r\\nbased on a decision tree, such as a separate counter for a logon action between 12\\r\\nam and 6 am. Le et al. found that for frequency features, the session-based and 24-\\r\\nhour time windows data worked best.  In addition to frequency features, they used\\r\\nstatistical features:  descriptive statistics such as the mean, median and standard\\r\\ndeviation of properties related to user actions.  From this, as they kept track of all\\r\\nactivity within the session, too, we infer that the daily frequency features will suit our\\r\\napproach best.  Within the CERT dataset, linking the temporal dependencies is es-\\r\\nsential. When someone logs in on a deviating hour, opens a cloud storage website,\\r\\nplugs in a USB and starts uploading, the sequence of events makes it an apparent\\r\\nanomaly of, for example, espionage attempting to exfiltrate company secrets. Single\\r\\nlog entries are likely not enough to detect deviating behaviour.

Additionally, operating outside of office hours is likely to delay a reaction\\r\\nfrom the victim’s side.\\r\\nThe profiling of user behaviour and detection of its deviations is tackled in dif-\\r\\nferent ways in the literature.  The two main ways of processing the feature vectors\\r\\nto profile user behaviour are via statistical tests or ML. Statistical tests allow for a\\r\\nsimple method of giving different weights to vectors. On the other hand, ML is more\\r\\nwidely used by related work and has yielded better results.  Most often, a type of\\r\\nanomaly  detection  was  used  to  detect  insider  threats  or  compromised  accounts,\\r\\nranging from, e.g. LSTM Auto-encoders to Gaussian Mixed Models. Applying such\\r\\na mechanism is out of scope for this research, as it would require further research\\r\\non  which  types  of  anomaly  detection  are  suitable  for  CERT  and  production  data\\r\\nand how they work under the hood.   Anomaly detection is possible in both a su-\\r\\npervised and unsupervised manner.  However, the supervised version is generally\\r\\nonly suitable when ground truth is available on, for example, insiders or user roles.\\r\\nBefore able to detect anomalies, we need to be able to profile users meaningfully\\r\\nand consistently over time. For that, we focus on clustering to develop this profiling\\r\\nmethodology.\\r\\nK-means clustering\\r\\nThere  are  several  methods  readily  available  to  use  in  python  libraries,  such  as\\r\\nsklearn4.   We  do  not  survey  all  of  them,  but  choose  an  explainable  one  to  test\\r\\nour research on. The explainability is important because of its intended use for real-\\r\\nworld data involving humans,  it is impermissable for an algorithm to mark a user\\r\\nas suspicious without a transparent reasoning behind it.  The reason for choosing\\r\\nK-means as a clustering method is threefold. First, different clustering mechanisms\\r\\nare suitable for different dataset characteristics,  such as whether the groups are\\r\\neven in size or what order of magnitude the number of clusters is.   Because our\\r\\napproach should be as generally applicable as possible without requiring domain\\r\\nknowledge  on  the  input  user  base,  we  cannot  describe  the  dataset  beforehand.\\r\\nSecond, clustering algorithms require input parameters describing, e.g. the dataset\\r\\nor the desired amount of clusters. Similar to the previous option, there are very few\\r\\nparameters we can automatically generate based on the input user dataset. Finally,\\r\\nthis research is a proof-of-concept on what inferences we can make by clustering\\r\\nusers based on access behaviour and be able to explain the outcome, not to find the\\r\\n4sklearn library clustering methods:https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.\\r\\nhtml\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"FiYZ1aGCTIdYJ36aQAuC6sTRuXOM5YO5yHtsINT4c14=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_27":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_27\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":27,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\n3.5.

The main drawback of this algorithm is that it does\\r\\nnot perform very well on clusters of different sizes. This could, in future research, be\\r\\nsolved by profiling the feature vectors before clustering and selecting the clustering\\r\\napproach based on this, but discovering the perfect clustering algorithm falls outside\\r\\nof the scope of this research.\\r\\nAccess log data used\\r\\nThere are multiple stages where it is possible to monitor user access behaviour.\\r\\nDuring authentication via Kerberos,  when a user authenticates against the DC a\\r\\nWindows Event describes what type of service a TGS (Ticket Granting Server) had\\r\\nbeen requested for.  Then a user logs onto the host and performs actions on this\\r\\ndevice. Our goal is to detect it when a user suspiciously changes access behaviour\\r\\nfrom their regular profile.  We want this detection to be as generally applicable as\\r\\npossible.   Logged authentication events are hard to correlate because TGSs are\\r\\ncommonly not sent to the SIEM and authentication tokens are valid for en extended\\r\\nperiod of time, making monitoring difficult for, e.g.  outside office hour activity.  We\\r\\nalso need to decide which devices we can use the logs from. Logs from endpoint de-\\r\\nvices such as employee laptops generate many events. Since there are many such\\r\\ndevices, a SIEM would be flooded with data if they were all onboarded to the SIEM.\\r\\nTherefore, these endpoint devices are commonly not onboarded, making them hard\\r\\nto monitor.  As previously mentioned, servers are among the most valuable assets\\r\\nwithin an organisation, so we will limit our monitoring to those servers. Additionally,\\r\\nmany employee devices will need to connect to such servers to access domain-\\r\\nwide resources.

Using this, we can filter out users who have only accessed\\r\\n< Nmachines from our analysis.  Too many users with identical access behaviour\\r\\nskews the K-means clustering method, as there will be large number of users with\\r\\nthe same feature vector.  This causes a huge ’gravitational center’, meaning most\\r\\ncentroids will move towards this user group.  This lowers the granularity to which\\r\\nother users can be classified into clusters.  Additionally, such users are less suspi-\\r\\ncious when ignoring the significance of certain machines.

Using this, we divide the total duration of the log data into\\r\\nthese  shorter  timeframe  lengths  and  count  how  many  accesses  (logons)  a  user\\r\\nperformed within that timeframe. If the timeframe is increased to one week instead of\\r\\none day, there will be less and more generic feature vectors per user. If we decrease\\r\\nthe timeframe to 1 hour, every user will have many more statistical feature vectors\\r\\nper timeframe, which values deviate a lot.

METHODOLOGY\\r\\nOffice HoursAnother important characteristic within logon data is whether a logon\\r\\ntook place during or outside of office hours [18].  A user accessing more resources\\r\\noutside of office hours than regular could be indication for an account compromise.\\r\\nTherefore for every timeframe, we calculate how many of the logins were outside of\\r\\noffice hours. For weekdays this is defined as before 7:00 or after 21:00, as based on\\r\\n5.1.  A weekend access is always outside of office hours.  From these features per\\r\\ntimeframe we also calculate the mean, median and standard deviation as statistical\\r\\nfeatures.  The same features per timeframe and corresponding statistical features\\r\\nare computed for accesseswithinoffice hours.\\r\\nNovel accessesPer timeframe, we count how many of the resources were ac-\\r\\ncessed for the first time:newlyaccessedresourceamtintimeframeyyyymmdd.\\r\\nThis is important to profile an account used for network discovery or propagation.\\r\\nSuch behaviour will make many accesses for the first time, ones which the legiti-\\r\\nmate user or the person whilst they were still acting benign had the rights to but\\r\\nnever previously accessed. As with the above features, the mean, median and stan-\\r\\ndard deviation statistical features are computed.\\r\\nCumulative  difference  from  the  meanTo  find  patterns  in  changing  behaviour\\r\\nover time,  we introduce a new feature:  thecumulative difference from mean ac-\\r\\ncesses until timeframe X. This feature is used to keep track of trends over time,\\r\\nsuch as a user continuing to access more resources over time. This feature can be\\r\\ncompared to the Cumulative Sum control chart (CUSUM). The CUSUM is a method\\r\\nto monitor change: A temporal sequence of values is standardised and compared to\\r\\nthe expected value. If the difference is larger than a pre-defined parameter (e.g., half\\r\\na standard deviation), it gets added to the running cumulative deviation sum. There\\r\\nare separate running sums for both positive or negative changes in value.  This is\\r\\nmost likely not applicable to our case with daily accesses. Here our ’expected value’\\r\\nis the average value up until a given timeframe, and any timeframe where a person\\r\\ndoes not access any resources (e.g., weekends or vacation days) would cause a\\r\\nsignificant negative deviation.  This lowers the mean and causes the next working\\r\\nday to be a significant positive deviation et cetera.  In our implementation, positive\\r\\nand negative deviations can cancel each other out, so the only way for this cumula-\\r\\ntive difference value to increase significantly over time is if on average, a user keeps\\r\\naccessing more resources than the time period before. It is also possible to monitor\\r\\nfor especiallyaccesses outside of office hoursornovel accessesby simply using\\r\\nthat feature instead ofnumber of accesses per day. An example of how this feature\\r\\nis constructed is provided in Figure 4.1.\\r\\n1.

This  is  especially  impor-\\r\\ntant  for  Machine  Learning  methods  which  calculate  the  distance  between  points\\r\\nin the multidimensional spectrum.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a method to reduce the dimensions\\r\\nof points in multidimensional space, which is in our case the feature vector per user.\\r\\nThis is performed whilst retaining as much information as possible.

The latter inevitably leads to information loss.\\r\\nPCA tries to express a combination of features in a newcomponent, by inputting a\\r\\ncertain percentage of every feature. An example of this for the first PCA dimension\\r\\n(PCA 1) and the second PCA dimension (PCA 2) is shown in Figure 4.3.\\r\\nSince variance is information, the first coordinate (principal component) captures\\r\\nthe greatest variance, the second coordinate captures the second greatest variance\\r\\net cetera.

Therefore, per cluster, we compute the\\r\\nmean, median and standard deviation of every feature.  Using the Role information\\r\\nfrom the CERT dataset, we compute the same values for every role group for every\\r\\nfeature.\\r\\n9) Quantifying performance\\r\\nThere are multiple ways to quantify clustering performance, depending on the moti-\\r\\nvation. We quantify performance in two different ways. First, to see if clusters can be\\r\\nuser to group people of the same role, we compare the clusters via the role informa-\\r\\ntion as provided in the CERT dataset. This can be done either visually or using the\\r\\nRand index4. The Rand index is earlier elaborated upon in Section 2.3, and gives a\\r\\nscore between 0 and 1 on how similar two cluster divisions are. We use the version\\r\\nwhich adjusts for chance, to compensate for ’lucky guesses’ by our clustering algo-\\r\\nrithm.\\r\\nAnother method to quantify clustering performance is to see how stable they are\\r\\nover time. This is achieved by applying the clustering algorithm based on the data of\\r\\ne.g. one month, and doing this for several months during a year. Then, we compare\\r\\neach month pair-wise via the abovementioned Rand index, using just the data from\\r\\nusers which were active in both periods and filtering out the malicious actors.  This\\r\\nwill result per pair of months, a score on how similar the clusterings are. There is to\\r\\nour knowledge no literature performing such comparison over time hence we have\\r\\nno baseline of what values would be acceptable or good. Therefore, we assume that\\r\\nbenign user’s behaviour does not change between months and aim for the values\\r\\nclosest to 1.0 as possible, as this would mean an identical clustering.\\r\\nHaving stable clusters means a SOC can take a user’s access behaviour over\\r\\na certain time period, compare it to the behaviour of all other users and determine\\r\\nwhose behaviour is alike.  If we assume that the majority of users within a cluster\\r\\nstay benign, a user leaving this cluster over time can be regarded as a suspicious\\r\\n4Rand  index  adjusted  for  chance:https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/\\r\\nsklearn.metrics.adjusted_rand_score.html\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"puD4VTitwIz710+lZb/vjYGkNfZAIBR+KXxwv73zV0s=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_38":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_38\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":38,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\n32                                                                                             CHAPTER4.  METHODOLOGY\\r\\naccess behaviour change.  A SOC analyst would take a closer look at the histori-\\r\\ncal behaviour of the user and gather contextual data to determine whether the be-\\r\\nhaviour is potentially malicious.   If too many users change clusters two problems\\r\\narise when comparing different time periods.  First, as a SOC analyst looks at all\\r\\nusers changing behaviour to determine its legitimacy, more users being marked as\\r\\nhaving suspicious behaviour leads to an increase in manual workload.  Second, if\\r\\nusers change behaviour this will affect the location of their cluster’s centroid.  The\\r\\ndynamic element of changing human behaviour is part of the reason why we ex-\\r\\npected ML to be more suitable for suspicious change detection rather than static\\r\\nthresholds.  However, if many users change behaviour and thereby possible switch\\r\\nclusters, this affects the locations of all centroids.  Then, it is not trivial anymore to\\r\\ndetermine which centroid’s cluster belonged to which group of users.  Determining\\r\\nthis is necessary to detect which users changed behaviour more than the rest of\\r\\ntheir cluster. Therefore, this approach would only work if the number of distinguish-\\r\\nable user groups stays the same, and that the majority of the users stay in their own\\r\\ncluster over time.  Huge behavioural shifts could be avoided by using smaller time\\r\\nperiods, however this increases the dataset skew as relative changes have a greater\\r\\ninfluence so might work counterproductive. We go further into this in Section 6.3.\\r\\n4.2    Sentinel\\r\\nFor the analysis within Sentinel the analysis methodology is comparable to CERT’s\\r\\nSection 4.1, only the data types and performance quantification possibilities are dif-\\r\\nferent.  Section 2.2 elaborates further on the functioning of Sentinel, including the\\r\\ndata and analysis possibilities.  The analysis is performed within a Sentinel Note-\\r\\nbook, which is a Jupyter Notebook whose kernel runs on an Azure virtual machine.\\r\\nThe Sentinel Notebook supports Python, ML libraries and supports integration with\\r\\nlogs stored in Sentinel.\\r\\n1) Ethical caveat\\r\\nBecause this research incorporates data generated by humans, it requires approval\\r\\nby the ethics committee of the University of Twente. To gain this approval, we had to\\r\\nset strict limits on what our data and inferences can and cannot be used for.\\r\\nBecause the dataset concerns human behaviour, a skew towards users behaving\\r\\nin  a  particular  manner  is  certainly  possible.   We  need  to  keep  this  skew  for  this\\r\\napproach to function in the real world.

Because of the data retention policies within Sen-\\r\\ntinel it is only possible to query data as far as 90 days back in time,  limiting the\\r\\ntemporal comparison possibilities.  Additionally, we have no knowledge on potential\\r\\ninsiders, so have to assume all profiled users are benign. Therefore, the number of\\r\\nperiods we can compare will depend on how much data is required to form a base-\\r\\nline profile for users.

We are left with the GroupMembership list.  As\\r\\nthese can consist of multiple groups overlapping for different users, we cannot com-\\r\\npare it to the clustering as with other distinct groups. Therefore we need a different\\r\\nmethod to compare our clustering to these group memberships. The method for this\\r\\nis described in Algorithm 1. This results in a score between 0 and 1 per user, which\\r\\nis the average similarity per user.

This equalises the importance of all individual fea-\\r\\ntures, as they all have the same range, limiting the influence of outliers. The relative\\r\\ndifference between a feature’s value between different users stays the same.\\r\\nAnother method of standardisation is achieved through QuantileTransformers11. This\\r\\nmethod  transforms  the  feature  values  to  follow  a  uniform  or  normal  distribution.\\r\\nThrough this, the relative distance to outliers are reduced which limits their impact.\\r\\nAdditionally,  values which are close together are spread out through this type of\\r\\ntransformation.\\r\\nDifferent clustering method\\r\\nAs the K-means clustering approach simply classifies the users closest to a centroid\\r\\ninto one cluster, this could blur the boundaries between clusters and is heavily in-\\r\\nfluenced by the randomised initial position of the centroids.  In addition, it does not\\r\\nrecognise clusters of different sizes well, whereas we could expect organisations to\\r\\nnot have evenly distributed groups of users with similar access behaviour.  There-\\r\\nfore, we apply the DBSCAN clustering approach12to get an indication whether this\\r\\ncould outperform K-means clustering with regards to clustering consistency or com-\\r\\nparison to peers and AD groups. DBSCAN clustering recognises densely populated\\r\\nareas in a multidimensional space and groups the users within such areas together\\r\\nin a cluster.  If an area is not densely populated, then the users within this area are\\r\\nnot put into a cluster at all.  A single parameter is required for this function: theep-\\r\\nsilon.

Under the hood Windows can keep connecting and disconnecting to for ex-\\r\\nample a remote file server, causing a lot of events.  This can lead to over 500.000\\r\\nevents on a single day alone.

This lead to a slight improvement\\r\\nin clustering stability score, as seen in Figure 5.19, but is still far from a stable clus-\\r\\ntering.

This is because of the way Windows operates in\\r\\nthe background when connecting to another device,  as explained in Section 4.2.\\r\\nTherefore, not every access logged correlates to a user interaction.

With this type of logon, one user action does correlate to a single\\r\\nlogon event.  In addition, there are significantly fewer events hence we could incor-\\r\\nporate the data of an entire month and include the session duration feature. RDP is\\r\\nalso often used by threat actors to use a compromised account for lateral movement.\\r\\nTherefore this behaviour could visibly change compared to a user’s regular actions.\\r\\nUnfortunately, filtering on RDP only decreased the cluster stability when comparing\\r\\nconsecutive months, as shown in Figure 5.20.

DISCUSSION ANDRECOMMENDEDRESEARCHDIRECTIONS\\r\\nITAdmins versus other users\\r\\nOur clustering approach can separate users with the ITAdmin role from regular users\\r\\nwith ease. The main defining features for this were the average daily accesses and\\r\\nsession length, as Appendix A.1 reveals that ITAdmins perform more and shorter\\r\\nsessions. This is an inference that we could not have gotten by reading the dataset\\r\\ndescription, which only decribes ITAdmins having global access privileges.\\r\\nAs shown in Table 5.1, our clustering approach works well in detecting admin insid-\\r\\ners as they switch clusters in the period of their insider actions.\\r\\nInvestigation of the logon actions of ITAdmin users revealed that they perform no\\r\\nfurther accesses soon after their last insider actions are performed. This decreases\\r\\nthe ITAdmin’s number of accesses for the month they performed malicious actions\\r\\nin, which skews their behaviour from an ITAdmin user to a regular user.  Within the\\r\\nscenario where the CERT Insider Threat dataset is created this implies that after\\r\\nsomeone  has  performed  their  malicious  actions  they  leave  the  company  straight\\r\\naway.  This type of detection limits itself to a certain type of insider, and could also\\r\\ntrigger when a user is less productive than regular.  The latter is not a security risk\\r\\nand quite invasive,  and would be regarded as a False Positive for our algorithm.\\r\\nTherefore, in this case, our algorithm does not detect a suspicious change in be-\\r\\nhaviour through a user accessingmoreresources than usual, but by a user access-\\r\\ninglessresources than usual.  This has overlap with the research topic of Quitting\\r\\nDetection.  Quitting detection is a subject within Insider Threat detection research\\r\\nwhich focuses on predicting that a user will turn against their employer. This is used\\r\\nin the insider threat detection research by Gavai et al. [24], who use quitting detec-\\r\\ntion as a proxy for insider threat detection. Therefore, our clustering approach works\\r\\nwell in quitting detection for ITAdmins, but only after the user has actually quit.\\r\\n6.2    Real-world production environment clustering\\r\\nObservations\\r\\nDue to the problems with query limits as described in Section 5.2, we performed\\r\\nthe majority of the clustering using one week of data.  Since this is relatively short,\\r\\nthe feature vector values are unlikely to converge (yet) for every user, as the mean,\\r\\nmedian and standard deviation shift with every added day of data. The feature most\\r\\ninfluenced by this is the ’deviation from the average number of daily accesses value’.\\r\\nWeekend or vacation days therefore have significant influence on this value, which\\r\\nis likely to lead to the distribution as seen in Figure 5.11.

REAL-WORLD PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT CLUSTERING63\\r\\nclustering plot.  Such users usually had more accesses than other users.  This is,\\r\\nhowever,  also incorporated in other features.  Additionally,  as we had no data on\\r\\nactual lateral movement or insider threats we removed this feature for the remainder\\r\\nof research using production data, as it did not contribute to explainable clustering.\\r\\nOutlier user account, or users alone in a cluster, usually proved to be service ac-\\r\\ncounts or admin accounts. Such clusters had a few specific hosts as most important\\r\\nfeature as they were the only one to log onto that resource, and logged out outside\\r\\nof office hours more often than other users. This fits the ITAdmin feature values ob-\\r\\ntained from the CERT dataset, with admin users operating outside of regular office\\r\\nhours more often.  Additionally, automated user accounts can run in an automated\\r\\nmanner, ignoring office hours.  Therefore, being an outlier can be indicative of an\\r\\nautomated account or administrator behaviour.\\r\\nInferences on formed clusters\\r\\nThe UserPeerAnalytics and AD group comparison scores,  computed through our\\r\\ncustom metric, did not come close to the theoretical maximum of 1.0. Therefore we\\r\\ncompared our clustering to that of a randomly clustered users, both with the same\\r\\nand a random distribution among clusters. Our clustering consistently outperformed\\r\\nrandom  labels  by  on  average  0.1  for  the  UserPeerAnalytics  and  0.03  for  the  AD\\r\\ngroups.  This implies that there is still some signal in the access data related to AD\\r\\ngroups, and related to the way Microsoft’s UEBA computes their user peer groups.\\r\\nAs the metrics to compare our clusters to AD groups and UserPeerAnalytics are\\r\\nniche, we have no way of comparing them to existing literature. We do have to place\\r\\na note regarding the AD group scoring metric. No scores outside of the 0.40 - 0.47\\r\\nrange were observed for the entirety of the research, and most were in the 0.42 -\\r\\n0.45 range. This suggests that the eventual score is influenced by the amount of AD\\r\\ngroups and their sizes more than it is by our actual clustering.  We did, however, in\\r\\nall cases get a higher score for our clustering than for a randomised user labelling\\r\\nusing the same distribution.  In general, fewer clusters will decrease the AD group\\r\\ncomparison score through the user being compared to more other users, who likely\\r\\ndiffer more in AD groups.  If an organisation has many large AD groups, such as\\r\\n’All users in the Netherlands’ for an international organisation, this increases the AD\\r\\ncomparison score. Fewer clusters increase the likeliness that more of a user’s peers\\r\\nare in the same cluster, increasing the peer score.  Therefore gaining information\\r\\nfrom these scores requires knowledge on the organisation’s groups.

Either way, prior to using these\\r\\nscores as an indicator of clustering quality one should therefore research the impact\\r\\nthe number of clusters has on either of them.\\r\\nThe AD groups featured several groups for users with certain administrative privi-\\r\\nleges. Further inspection revealed that two clusters encompassed all global domain\\r\\nadmins, and almost all users within admin groups.  These clusters, however, also\\r\\ncontained a lot of non-admin users.  Hence, if a user were to move to this cluster,\\r\\nit would not necessarily mean they displayed admin access behaviour. The few ac-\\r\\ncounts which were part of admin AD groups but not in one of the beforementioned\\r\\ntwo clusters had different characteristics to the rest, such as Job Title or Department.\\r\\nThis could point to a misconfiguration, however deeper analysis of the situation re-\\r\\nquires domain knowledge of the organisation as well as their privilege and AD group\\r\\noverview.  This type of analysis is closer to the Baaz [6] tool, and would not require\\r\\naccess data as input. There was one cluster with only a handful of members, where\\r\\nthe cluster average on the ’outside office hours accesses’ feature was significantly\\r\\nhigher than any other cluster.  However, we did not find a common denominator in\\r\\ne.g. AD groups or IdentityInfo for this cluster. Therefore, we found no correlation us-\\r\\nable in practice between our access behaviour clusters and admin privileged users.\\r\\nClustering consistency\\r\\nThe  clustering  consistency  expressed  in  adjusted  Rand  value  drops  significantly\\r\\ncompared to the CERT dataset results.  When the goal is to detect suspicious user\\r\\naccess behaviour through a user switching clusters over time, we require the ma-\\r\\njority benign users to stay in their original cluster.  This is currently not the case,\\r\\nassuming most users in our dataset are benign.  Visual PCA inspection shows that\\r\\nwhilst there is a clear distinction between the cluster in the CERT dataset in Figure\\r\\n5.3, for the production data clustering in Figure 5.12 users are gathered together in\\r\\none large group.

How-\\r\\never, creating a user profile through a longer period of time also has downsides.  If\\r\\nmalicious behaviour is only shown on e.g. one day of the entire incorporated month,\\r\\nit is likely to have minimal influence on the user’s feature vector.  Even if the mali-\\r\\ncious behaviour is shown for a longer period of time, this behavioural change would\\r\\nonly be shown after the entire clustering period has passed.

We did not perform further analysis on what this shape\\r\\nimplies on the underlying data, but the key inference is that most users are clustered\\r\\nclosely together. This likely causes K-means to classify many users differently over\\r\\ntime, leading to low similarity scores.\\r\\nAs elaborated in the Methodology section,  one of the reasons we employ ML\\r\\nfor  our  feature  vectors  instead  of  static  thresholds  is  to  account  for  the  dynamic\\r\\nbehaviour users have.

In\\r\\nthe case all other users change behaviour often according to our feature vectors,\\r\\nusers will be classified into different clusters often.  This is the intended behaviour\\r\\nfor our algorithm,  but it leads to more workload for a SOC due to an increase in\\r\\nfalse positives and is, therefore, no added value to them.

This approach was validated using the synthetic CERT dataset, where\\r\\nusers were profiled consistently using mainly time and resource-based features.  In\\r\\nproduction, using the same features, we could not achieve the same consistency in\\r\\nclustering due to the similarity in most users’ access behaviour.

The element of randomness in K-means clustering can cause\\r\\nusers in bordering clusters to switch continuously over time.  Additionally, the grav-\\r\\nitational centers (centroids) tend towards larger groups.  Many people sharing the\\r\\nsame behaviour will therefore skew the rest of the groups. In our research, every re-\\r\\nsource had as much influence as any other as feature in the multidimensional area,\\r\\nwhilst in reality some resources could be more relevant for clustering than others.\\r\\nThis can be done according to the resource importance, or type such as file server\\r\\nor domain controller.  That way, it is likely that one of the clusters will contain users\\r\\naccessing the crown jewels amongst resources, which are likely to be administra-\\r\\ntors.  Giving weight to resources enables detecting users suddenly connecting to\\r\\nvital infrastructure whereas usually they did not.  Combining this with other proper-\\r\\nties of an access event, such as using RDP for the first time to connect to a DC1, is\\r\\nsignificant data when keeping track of an ’anomaly score’, such as our cumulative\\r\\ndifference from the mean number of accesses.  This also requires mapping adver-\\r\\nsarial actions to potential indicators in the data, the RDP connection to a DC in the\\r\\nbeforementioned case.  In addition to resources, of the weight of any feature could\\r\\nof course be increased relative to less important features.  Whilst we had statistics\\r\\nper cluster on which resources were accessed most often, this did not enable us to\\r\\ndraw a picture on what type of users populated a cluster.  As the resources them-\\r\\nselves were a significant feature for the clustering, classifying the resources could\\r\\nshow a ’bigger picture’ of what types of resources users access, providing a better\\r\\npicture of a cluster’s regular behaviour. Therefore, in future research we would also\\r\\nrecommend categorizing the resources and using the categories as features.\\r\\nIn the Sentinel data gathering phase our approach still required a lot of manual\\r\\nwork in removing outliers which were deemed automated accounts.   Additionally,\\r\\nbecause of the amount of events we had to summarise the logon data per hours,\\r\\nand for monthly clustering we manually aggregated data of several weeks because\\r\\nof the 500.000 row limit on KQL queries.  Removing redundant ’noisy’ accounts in\\r\\nan earlier phase preserves more of the 500.000 row limit to the accounts which are\\r\\nactually used for the clustering.  This could be computed and filtered by KQL in the\\r\\nquery itself already. Furthermore, KQL is able to count events and aggregate data,\\r\\nso is also able to compute the full feature vectors per user from the raw data.

CONCLUSION\\r\\nbetween many user’s values, then small deviations can lead to significantly different\\r\\nclusterings.  This is due to the the primitive method K-means works, combined with\\r\\nthe randomness of the initialisation phase.\\r\\nHow  does  our  profiling  methodology  perform  within  the  CERT\\r\\nv4.2 synthetic dataset on consistency and extracting user groups?\\r\\nThe profiling methodology creates a clear distinction between users with the ITAd-\\r\\nmin role and users without.  The distinctive feature values of ITAdmins show that\\r\\nthey perform more accesses, have shorter session durations and more accesses\\r\\noutside of office hours compared to other users.  Other than the ITAdmins, no clear\\r\\nrole distinction could be made. For the K=5 value the clusters are consistent with an\\r\\naverage adjusted Rand score of 0.87 for consecutive months.\\r\\nHow does this profiling methodology translate to real-world data\\r\\nin terms of consistency and extracted user groups?\\r\\nFor production data our features show less separation between the users, so slight\\r\\nbehavioural  changes  causes  users  to  switch  clusters  often.   Additionally,  the  K-\\r\\nmeans initialisation phase is random so users close to bordering clusters can ran-\\r\\ndomly switch clusters. Increasing the timespan over which the features are created\\r\\nhas a slight positive effect on the consistency, but stays at an adjusted Rand score\\r\\nof 0.41 for consecutive periods.   Hence,  the consistency does not come close to\\r\\nthe one achieved for the synthetic CERT dataset and cannot be used in practice for\\r\\nidentifying suspicious access behaviour.\\r\\nThere is a mediocre similarity between our extracted clusters, AD groups and Mi-\\r\\ncrosoft UEBA’s UserPeerAnalytics.

This is likely due quitting after the malicious\\r\\nactions have taken place.\\r\\nFor real-world data, we conclude that there is not enough granularity between these\\r\\nfeatures to consistently profile users.  Through this methodology, it is not possible\\r\\nto determine deviating behaviour accurately using solely logon data. Profiling users\\r\\nconsistently using explainable clustering requires at least different pre-processing\\r\\nto bring more granularity to the available data.  The exact insider threat or account\\r\\ncompromise actions should be determined beforehand to tailor to an adversarial in-\\r\\ndicator. More invasive data is likely required to differ between users, as was used by\\r\\nsimilar research to achieve higher insider threat and account compromise detection\\r\\nscores.\\r\\nTo summarise, we converted non-invasive access logs into a feature vector per user.\\r\\nWe applied K-means clustering to these feature vectors and compared the formed\\r\\nclusters with known user groups. We also compared clusters of different periods in\\r\\ntime to each other.  Whilst for a synthetical dataset this yielded promising results,\\r\\nin production data we could not get useful inferences from the resulting clusters.  It\\r\\nwas also not possible to construct consistent user profiles over time, since we were\\r\\nunable to separate users clearly on their access behaviour.  Therefore it could not\\r\\nbe used by a SOC to detect suspicious deviations in user access behaviour.\\r\\nBecause of these findings, the Northwave SOC is looking into how they can include\\r\\nother types of data to achieve more granularity between users.  Since we were un-\\r\\nable  to  use  the  clusters  in  a  meaningful  manner  in  a  real-world  setting,  another\\r\\nMachine Learning method will be applied that is targeted solely at anomaly detec-\\r\\ntion.\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"5mR7Vm2A/qqKF7VbfcXKIG8edYnKu087VnBepoCrI68=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_82":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_82\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":82,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\n76                                                                                                 CHAPTER7.

INTRODUCTION \\r\\nCybercriminals  often  focus  their  attention  on  healthcare \\r\\nproviders  and  related  institutions.  The  continuum  of  care \\r\\nresults  in  a  landscape  that  is  convoluted  and  diverse  in  terms \\r\\nof the individuals, devices, apps, and procedures that comprise \\r\\nit. This landscape provides potential entry points for attackers \\r\\ninto  the network.  A  further  tactic  that  attackers  might  use  to \\r\\ncarry out ransomware attacks is to threaten the interruption of \\r\\nessential  life-saving  utilities.  The  culmination  of  all  these \\r\\nactions  produces  data  that  may  be  put  to  use  to  trace  down \\r\\nattackers and stop them in their path. Indicators of data breach \\r\\nmay  be  found  across  all  sectors,  but  healthcare  organizations \\r\\nwant   high-quality   data   that   is   tailored   to   their   operating \\r\\nconditions in order to cut down on the amount of time it takes \\r\\nto discover and react to threats. Due to the sensitive nature of \\r\\npatient  data,  the  healthcare  business  is  a  top  target  for  the \\r\\nperpetration   of   cyberattacks.   It   is   possible   for   patients, \\r\\nhealthcare  professionals,  and  healthcare  organizations  to  face \\r\\nserious repercussions as a result of the theft, loss, or improper \\r\\nuse of sensitive information. As a result, it is essential to have \\r\\nan  efficient  cybersecurity  plan  in  order  to  safeguard  patient \\r\\ndata  and  stay  in  compliance  with  HIPAA  regulations.  An \\r\\nautomated  SOC can  identify  and react to potential dangers in \\r\\nreal   time,   making   it   possible   to   take   a   complete   and \\r\\npreventative  approach  to  information  security.  The  manual \\r\\nSOC  technique  that  has  been  used  in  the  past  is  no  longer \\r\\nadequate due to the growing number of cyber threats and their \\r\\nincreased   complexity.   An   automated   Security   Operations \\r\\nCenter  (SOC)  can  analyze  vast  amounts  of  data,  identify \\r\\ntrends, and detect dangers that human analysts may overlook. \\r\\nThis advantage over traditional SOCs allows for automation of \\r\\nmundane tasks like patch management, vulnerability scanning, \\r\\nand  incident  response,  freeing  security  analysts  to  focus  on \\r\\nmore important responsibilities.  \\r\\nThis  leads  to  enhanced  efficiency  and  efficacy  in  threat \\r\\ndetection  and  response,  reducing  the  risk  of  cyberattacks  and \\r\\ndata breaches.  An  automated  SOC  plays  a  crucial  role  in \\r\\nprotecting patient data and maintaining HIPAA compliance. It \\r\\nenables  real-time  detection  and  response  to  cyber  threats, \\r\\nminimizing  the  risk  of  data  breaches  and  cyber  assaults. \\r\\nAdditionally,    an    automated SOC    can    help    healthcare \\r\\ncompanies   lower   the   cost   of   cybersecurity   operations   by \\r\\nautomating    mundane    operations    and    combining    threat \\r\\nintelligence,    vulnerability    management,    and    compliance \\r\\nmanagement. This integration helps identify potential security \\r\\nconcerns   before   they   become   a   threat,   minimizing   the \\r\\nprobability of data breaches and cyber assaults. The healthcare \\r\\nsector  is  increasingly  targeted  by  sophisticated  and  persistent \\r\\ncyber-attacks,  making  the  need  for  an  automated  SOC  even \\r\\nmore   crucial.   Advanced   capabilities   of   automated   SOC \\r\\nsolutions, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, \\r\\ncan  help  organizations  identify  and  respond  proactively  to \\r\\ncomplex threats. Overall, healthcare institutions must have  an \\r\\nautomated SOC to safeguard patient information and maintain \\r\\nHIPAA   compliance.   The   healthcare   industry   requires   an \\r\\nautomated   Security   Operations   Center   (SOC)   to   identify \\r\\nvulnerabilities  and  weaknesses  in  defense  mechanisms.  The \\r\\nMITRE    Attack    framework    enables    SOC    to    conduct \\r\\nsimulations   of   real-world   attack   scenarios,   maintaining   a \\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"1MQ/QJk0mhcetHbPFq4LcCViKHmfYPTiSZytopH12hs=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf_2":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf_2\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"9CbpqtFFHly5qLl5PstnpQ/uwpg1/tDRaLgiH266DUg=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_1":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_1\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":1,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Computers & Security 135 (2023) 103529\\r\\nAvailable online 6 October 20230167-4048/© 2023 The Author(s).

Additionally, the study examines the existing \\r\\nlandscape of metrics for SOCs and concludes that a majority of the metrics discussed in the literature primarily \\r\\nfocus on operational aspects rather than technical performance. The absence of adequate technical performance \\r\\nmetrics makes it challenging to accurately evaluate the tangible impact of a SOC on overall cyber defense \\r\\ncapabilities. The research also highlights the insufficiency of current methods in constructing metrics and \\r\\nframeworks tailored for measuring SOCs’ technical performance. The resulting framework offers SOCs means to \\r\\ncreate high-quality metrics for performance evaluation. Furthermore, the metrics the framework was validated \\r\\nwith offer SOCs an opportunity to enhance their ability to quantify their threat detection capabilities.\\r\\n1. Introduction\\r\\nCyber threats have evolved dramatically over the last few years. \\r\\nThey have become more sophisticated and complex, and as a result, \\r\\nthey have a greater impact on operational activities. The use of general-\\r\\npurpose malware has declined recently and more advanced threats, \\r\\nsuch as supply chain compromises, extortion activities, misinformation \\r\\ncampaigns, and business e-mail compromises, are continuously increas-\\r\\ning (European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, 2021). The increased \\r\\nsophistication and the associated risks require organizations to improve \\r\\ntheir defensive capabilities for combatting the evolving threat landscape \\r\\nbecause traditional malware and network defenses are not enough to \\r\\nprotect the organization from modern-day cyber threats.\\r\\nA strategy for organizations to increase their cyber defense capa-\\r\\nbilities is to acquire security operations center (SOC) capabilities. On \\r\\na general level, the SOC operations can be produced in-house, out-\\r\\nsourced to a managed service provider, or operated in a hybrid model in \\r\\nwhich the internal SOC is complemented by an external SOC provider. \\r\\nAccording to Nathans (2014), a SOC is typically responsible for detect-\\r\\ning security incidents and initiating related incident response activities. \\r\\nNathans also determined that depending on the size and the needs of \\r\\nthe organization, the SOC can consist of a single person or a larger \\r\\nteam working in 24/7 shifts that together form a coherent collection \\r\\nof different competencies to prevent, detect, and resolve cyber threats. \\r\\nFurthermore, Vielberth et al. (2020)mentioned there are several ways \\r\\n* Corresponding author.\\r\\nE-mail addresses:joonas.forsberg@iki.fi(J.Forsberg), tapio.k.frantti@jyu.fi(T.Frantti).\\r\\nto operate and design SOCs, and that the outcome is influenced by var-\\r\\nious factors, such as regulations, company strategy, and expertise.\\r\\nTo quantify the operational efficiency and capabilities of a SOC, \\r\\nperformance should be measured using a set of commonly agreed met-\\r\\nrics. A literature survey performed by Vielberth et al. (2020)concluded \\r\\nthat the currently established metrics are insufficient for measuring the \\r\\nperformance of the SOC. This viewpoint is supported by Kokulu et al. \\r\\n(2019), Agyepong et al. (2020)and Sundaramurthy et al. (2015).\\r\\nMultiple publications on SOCs focus primarily on quantitative vol-\\r\\nume and time-based operational and vulnerability-related metrics to \\r\\nmeasure the performance of SOCs (Nathans, 2014; Ahlm, 2021; Kokulu \\r\\net al., 2019). The operational metrics can help managers measure and \\r\\noptimize human resource utilization in analysis. Other quantitative met-\\r\\nrics, such as vulnerability-related data, can provide an overview of the \\r\\noverall exposure to known threats (Nathans, 2014). In practice, they \\r\\nare inefficient in measuring the capabilities of SOCs, because they can-\\r\\nnot measure the effectiveness of the detection capabilities and other \\r\\nprotective controls. Measuring the false-positive rate of the monitor-\\r\\ning rules is a common solution to combat this issue (Nathans, 2014; \\r\\nAhlm, 2021). However, considering the false-positive rate alone can be \\r\\nmisleading. The outcome of such metrics can be manipulated either sub-\\r\\nconsciously or consciously by the people responsible for the creation \\r\\nof the detection capabilities. Several studies have been performed on \\r\\ngeneral security metrics (Böhme, 2010; Pendleton et al., 2016; Salmi, \\r\\n2018), and there are also commonly referenced industry standards, such \\r\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2023.103529\\r\\nReceived 2 June 2023; Received in revised form 28 August 2023; Accepted 3 October 2023\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"mfZBFWCDZq7p/b0JeRPIbR33iwHLFZUjDooaT/4dfI4=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_2":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_2\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nComputers & Security 135 (2023) 103529\\r\\n2\\r\\nJ.ForsbergandT.Frantti\\r\\nas ISO/IEC 27004:2016 (2016)and NIST SP 800-55 (Chew et al., 2008), \\r\\nthat organizations can use to measure the effectiveness of their infor-\\r\\nmation security.\\r\\nAn argument could be made that an industry standard framework \\r\\nfor measuring SOCs does not exist at the moment. The lack of com-\\r\\nmonly accepted methods to measure the technical performance of a \\r\\nSOC is particularly prominent when the SOC is being outsourced to a \\r\\nthird-party vendor. This often leads to a situation where the tender-\\r\\ning process produces a suboptimal result, either by selecting the vendor \\r\\nwith the lowest total service cost or the most convincing sales mate-\\r\\nrial. In Finland, a trend has been observed, where vendors are chosen \\r\\non a proof of concept phase, in which an attack simulation is performed \\r\\nin an environment temporarily monitored by the vendor and afterward \\r\\ntheir threat detection capabilities are evaluated. The trend is essentially \\r\\na manifestation of the difficulty in evaluating the technical capabilities \\r\\nof different vendors. Although it can provide useful insights when com-\\r\\nparing vendors, the results are not truly comparable between vendors \\r\\nbecause the number of resources allocated to the proof of concept can \\r\\nsignificantly impact the final results and thus skew the vendor selection.\\r\\nThe objective of this study was to determine the metrics and other per-\\r\\nformance indicators relevant for measuring the technical performance of a \\r\\nSOC. Without properly constructed metrics, it is difficult to evaluate \\r\\nhow substantial impact the SOC has on the overall cyber defense capa-\\r\\nbilities. A technical performance metric within this paper is defined as \\r\\na qualitative or quantitative indicator derived from one or more measure-\\r\\nments resulting from the activities performed by the SOC, which describes \\r\\nhow well the SOC can utilize technologies to prevent, identify, detect, and \\r\\nrespond to cyber threats affecting the organization.Compared to an opera-\\r\\ntional performance metric, a technical performance metric attempts to \\r\\nquantify the defensive capabilities, rather than assessing the effective-\\r\\nness of processes and people associated with the SOC. Understanding \\r\\nboth the operational and technical efficiency of the SOC is required to \\r\\nsuccessfully protect an organization from cyber threats and measure the \\r\\neffectiveness of the SOC.\\r\\nThe objective leads to the following research questions: (1) What \\r\\nframeworks are available to measure the performance of a SOC?(2) What \\r\\nare the commonly mentioned key metrics used to measure a SOC?(3) Can \\r\\nthe common metrics be used to measure the technical performance?(4) How \\r\\ncan the metrics be improved to enhance the reporting capabilities of technical \\r\\nperformance?The expected outcome of the research is a novel frame-\\r\\nwork that could contribute to an industry-standard way to measure the \\r\\ntechnical performance of a SOC and apply to most SOCs.\\r\\n2. Research methodology\\r\\nDesign science research methodology is used as the primary research \\r\\nmethodology in this research. The research follows the principles de-\\r\\nfined by Peffers et al. (2007), in which a design science artifact is \\r\\ngenerated as an outcome of an iterative process with the following ac-\\r\\ntivities: (1) Identify the problem and motivation, (2) Define the objectives of \\r\\na solution, (3) Design and development, (4) Demonstration, (5) Evaluation\\r\\nand (6) Communication.\\r\\nThe first activity is covered in sections1, 3and 4of this research, \\r\\nthe second in section5, the third in section6, the fourth in section7and \\r\\nthe fifth in sections8and 9. This research as a whole covers the sixth \\r\\nactivity. The second activity is supported by a brief literature review of \\r\\nboth academic publications and commercial sources to establish suffi-\\r\\ncient theoretical background on the subject, and to answer the research \\r\\nquestions (1) and (2). A keyword search is used as the search method \\r\\nfor the discovery of literature related to SOCs and metrics. The search \\r\\nquery for SOC-related literature is ‘(security OR cyber security) (oper-\\r\\nations OR operation) (center OR centre)’and the metric-related search \\r\\nquery is ‘(metric OR measurement OR “performance indicator”)’. The lit-\\r\\nerature review was performed between May and September in the year \\r\\n2022 and updated in August 2023. JYKDOK,1IEEE Xplore2and Google \\r\\nScholar3were used as the search engines.\\r\\nThe research is expected to result in a design science artifact, a \\r\\nframework that can be utilized to create metrics to measure the tech-\\r\\nnical performance of SOCs. The design science artifact is validated \\r\\nfollowing the guidelines defined by Hevner et al. (2004), by follow-\\r\\ning the experimental evaluation method, which consists of controlled \\r\\nexperiments and simulations. The artifact is evaluated by utilizing it to \\r\\ncreate metrics to measure the technical performance of a SOC. The re-\\r\\nsulting metrics are evaluated with simulated data to ensure they behave \\r\\nas expected and produce meaningful insights for SOCs. The metrics are \\r\\nfurther evaluated in a controlled environment to ensure the measure-\\r\\nments required for the metrics can be collected in a fully operational \\r\\nSOC.\\r\\n3. Security operations center\\r\\nTo tackle the first phase of the design science research, problem iden-\\r\\ntification, we first introduce, how technical performance metrics target \\r\\nenvironments, i.e., SOCs, are described in the literature. One method to \\r\\ndescribe a SOC is through a People, Processes, and Technologies (PPT) \\r\\nframework (Knerler et al., 2022; Vielberth et al., 2020). Vielberth et al. \\r\\n(2020)summarized that the people block describes the people associ-\\r\\nated with the SOC and their required competencies, the process block \\r\\ndescribes how the people interact and how security incidents are han-\\r\\ndled, and the technology block describes the tools used to do the work. \\r\\nThey also argued that the PPT framework could be expanded to in-\\r\\nclude governance and compliance, enabling organizations to utilize the \\r\\nSOC as a function to ensure compliance with various standards, such as \\r\\nISO/IEC 27001, GDPR, or PCI-DSS.\\r\\nVielberth et al. (2020)stated, that the work performed at a SOC \\r\\nis heavily driven by processes, as the work is structured around the \\r\\nprevention, detection, and response of security incidents. The Com-\\r\\nputer Security Incident Handling Guide (NIST SP 800-61, Cichonski et \\r\\nal. (2012)) describes the security incident management process, which \\r\\nconsists of four phases “preparation,” “detection and analysis,” “con-\\r\\ntainment, eradication, and recovery,” and “post-incident activity,” as \\r\\ndepicted in Fig.1. The purpose of the preparation phase is to ensure the \\r\\nSOC has the necessary visibility and potential to detect and respond to \\r\\nsecurity incidents. The preparation stage also includes activities aiming \\r\\nto prevent security incidents altogether, such as malware prevention or \\r\\nuser awareness training. The detection and analysis phase consists of \\r\\nresponding to security incidents by analyzing, documenting, and pri-\\r\\noritizing them and finally notifying the necessary people. The third \\r\\nphase is about containing the security incident by limiting the poten-\\r\\ntial damage the incident may cause, followed by evidence gathering \\r\\nand identifying the attackers’ host. Once the impact of the incident has \\r\\nbeen limited and the source of the attack has been identified, the threat \\r\\ncan be eradicated, and recovery actions can be started (Cichonski et al., \\r\\n2012). The final stage, post-incident activity, does not contain activities \\r\\nfor which the SOC would typically be responsible. Other processes in \\r\\nthe SOC can, for example, include data collection and creation, valida-\\r\\ntion, and tuning monitoring rules (Knerler et al., 2022).\\r\\nA SOC can be further split into multiple collections of tightly inter-\\r\\nlinked functional areas, which according to Knerler et al.

Metrics and measurements\\r\\nThe primary purpose of a metric is to measure how well a business \\r\\nprocess, product, or resource performs so that a business decision can \\r\\nbe made Savola (2007). Typically, a metric consists of one or more dis-\\r\\ncrete point-in-time measurements, from which metrics are then derived. \\r\\nSavola (2013)continues that to produce quality metrics for security, the \\r\\nmetrics must conform to four fundamental quality criteria: correctness, \\r\\nmeasurability, meaningfulness, and usability.\\r\\n4.1. Constructing metrics\\r\\nMetrics can be structured in multiple ways. A metric can simply \\r\\nbe a direct relation to a measurement, such as the number of security \\r\\nincidents, or it can be a composite metric constructed by multiple mea-\\r\\nsurements collected from multiple sources. An example of a composite \\r\\nmetric is depicted in Fig.2, in which the metric is constructed from mul-\\r\\ntiple measurements. Measurement A collects the detections generated \\r\\nby security tooling, such as Security Information Event Management \\r\\n(SIEM), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), or Intrusion Detection \\r\\nSystem (IDS). The detections generated by the tools are analyzed by se-\\r\\ncurity analysts. Measurement B consists of reports from end-users and \\r\\nother third parties about possible security incidents, such as suspected \\r\\nphishing or security policy violations. Similar to measurement A, the \\r\\ntickets in measurement B are investigated by the analysts. The metric \\r\\nconfiguration selects the measurements, for which the reaction time by \\r\\nthe analysts exceeds the pre-determined value. The reaction time could \\r\\nfor example be defined in a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between a \\r\\nSOC and other stakeholders.\\r\\nThere are several ways to construct or select metrics that measure \\r\\nthe outcome of an activity. A study by Doran (1981)describes a method \\r\\nthat utilizes the S.M.A.R.T. method, which is an acronym for specific, \\r\\nmeasurable, assignable, realistic, and time-related, to select a suitable \\r\\nmetric. Brotby and Hinson (2013)introduces the PRAGMATIC method \\r\\nthat consists of nine meta metrics (predictive, relevant, actionable, gen-\\r\\nuine, meaningful, accurate, timely, independent, and cheap), which are \\r\\nessentially scoring criteria for the metric itself.\\r\\nThe S.M.A.R.T. and PRAGMATIC methods are more about select-\\r\\ning metrics and which principles should be embraced when a metric \\r\\nis constructed. There are also other methods to construct metrics. For \\r\\nexample, the Annex A of the ISO/IEC 27004:2016 (2016)standard sum-\\r\\nmarizes a measurement information model contained in the ISO/IEC \\r\\n15939 standard and describes how specific attributes related to an en-\\r\\ntity can be converted into an information product that can be used for \\r\\nconducting business decisions.\\r\\n4.2. Problems and pitfalls of metrics\\r\\nMetrics can provide valuable insights into the performance of an or-\\r\\nganization. However, when incorrectly constructed, they can become \\r\\ncounterproductive. The metric can be incorrect due to a problem with \\r\\nthe raw measurements, a programming error in the algorithm used to \\r\\nderive the metric, or someone is either maliciously or non-maliciously \\r\\nmisinterpreting the metric (Brotby and Hinson, 2013). Hauser and Katz \\r\\n(1998)argues that it might also be possible that certain metrics, which \\r\\nare hard to influence by the activities of team members, might lead to \\r\\na situation where short-term decisions are favored over long-term deci-\\r\\nsions. A metric may also be precisely wrong, meaning that something \\r\\nis measured with high accuracy, but the metric does not improve the \\r\\nbusiness process it is supposed to improve (Hauser and Katz, 1998).\\r\\nWe can also approach the problems with metrics from the quality \\r\\nperspective. An attribute closely related to correctness is unbiasedness \\r\\nand objectivity, meaning the interpretation of the metric should not be \\r\\ninfluenced by personal beliefs or biases (Savola, 2007). Similarly, repro-\\r\\nducibility is closely related to measurability. If a result from a metric \\r\\ncannot be reliably reproduced, the metric may produce an incorrect \\r\\nvalue.\\r\\nThere may also be a problem with the quantity of the metrics. If \\r\\nthe metrics are incomplete, it is impossible to understand the overall \\r\\nsituation. However, having too many metrics can also be a source of \\r\\nincorrect decisions (Brotby and Hinson, 2013).\\r\\n4.3. Security operations center metrics\\r\\nVielberth et al.

There is significant research on security metrics, but the met-\\r\\nrics are mostly operational and non-technical. However, they identified \\r\\nsome technical metrics, such as false-positive rate, mean time to de-\\r\\ntect, threat actor attribution, and defensive efficiency. Nonetheless, they \\r\\nfailed to show meaningful metrics in several areas, such as automation \\r\\n& orchestration, threat hunting, and detection engineering & validation.\\r\\nNathans (2014)discussed SOC-related qualitative and quantitative \\r\\nmetrics utilized in managing a SOC. He also discussed the importance \\r\\nof vulnerability-related information in detecting potential security inci-\\r\\ndents by SOCs. The metrics related to the vulnerabilities are categorized \\r\\nas management-related metrics. He presented qualitative metrics, such \\r\\nas the top 10 vulnerable endpoints, and quantitative metrics, including \\r\\nthe number of vulnerable endpoints, the number of vulnerabilities per \\r\\nseverity, the number of unknown assets, and the time it took to apply a \\r\\npatch that fixed the vulnerability. However, the proposed metrics were \\r\\nnot sufficient to be used to demonstrate the technical capabilities of the \\r\\nSOC.\\r\\nAgyepong et al. (2020)presented a framework in which a SOC was \\r\\nsplit into multiple functions. Each function was measured separately to \\r\\ndetermine the actual performance of it. These functions included mon-\\r\\nitoring and detection, analysis, response and reporting, intelligence, \\r\\nbaseline and vulnerability, and policies and signature management. The \\r\\nframework proposed that each function should monitor its performance \\r\\nin quantitative and qualitative metrics. The framework did not provide \\r\\nconcrete measurement mechanisms upon which organizations can im-\\r\\nplement the metrics defined in the framework.\\r\\nKeltanen (2019)used results from a customer survey to measure the \\r\\nperformance of an outsourced SOC. He ranked the metrics based on the \\r\\nPRAGMATIC method. The resulting score will help evaluate different \\r\\nmetrics between one another, making it possible to determine which \\r\\nmetric is considered to be the most important (Keltanen, 2019). The \\r\\nstudy did not present concrete metrics that SOCs could use to measure \\r\\ntheir performance, instead focused on how the metrics could be con-\\r\\nstructed.\\r\\nKokulu et al. (2019) presented a qualitative study on the issues \\r\\nobserved by SOC practitioners. The study was based on interviewing \\r\\neighteen persons working in a SOC. The interviewed analysts men-\\r\\ntioned that the metrics selected for measuring the performance were \\r\\nused to measure completely irrelevant things and to demonstrate a false \\r\\nimprovement to the upper management rather than the actual perfor-\\r\\nmance of the SOC.\\r\\nOnwubiko (2015)presented a framework consisting of metrics used \\r\\nto evaluate SOCs’ performance and determine the return on investment. \\r\\nThe framework does not contain a concrete set of metrics, but instead, \\r\\nit provides the top five examples that should be considered, which are \\r\\nthe number of incidents, the performance of the cyber operations, the \\r\\ntop ten cyber attacks, a summary of policy violations and a summary of \\r\\nprivileged user misuse detections.\\r\\nAlahmadi et al. (2022)present a comprehensive qualitative study \\r\\nof SOC analysts’ perspectives on security alarms. The authors state \\r\\nthat security alarm validation is a tedious task that can cause alarm \\r\\nburnout and eventually desensitization. They continue that vendors \\r\\nand researchers must be able to make distinctions between types of \\r\\nfalse-positive alarms. They also argue that researchers have used false-\\r\\npositive as a metric for evaluating system performance when proposing \\r\\nsecurity tools, seeking few false-positives for optimal performance.\\r\\nIn addition to scientific literature, there is a plethora of commer-\\r\\ncial material that discusses the metrics to measure SOCs. Zimmerman \\r\\nand Crowley (2019)presented seven high-level groups for the metrics. \\r\\nThe groups are the health of the data feed, coverage of the monitoring, \\r\\nvulnerability-related metrics, monitoring rules, analysts’ performance, \\r\\nincident handling, risk priorities, and general hygiene.\\r\\nGartner published a guide (Ahlm, 2021) discussing the industry’s \\r\\nbest practices for building and operating a modern SOC, among which \\r\\na set of fundamental metrics were defined. The metrics mainly focused \\r\\non quantitative metrics and were grouped into four categories: incident \\r\\nvolume, incident detection, incident response, and incident impact. The \\r\\nmetrics in these categories, for most parts, are not relevant to the tech-\\r\\nnical performance of the SOC.\\r\\nSANS Institute (Crowley and Pescatore, 2019) surveyed 355 or-\\r\\nganizations about common and best practices for SOCs. There were \\r\\nquestions about which metrics are used in the SOC or measure its per-\\r\\nformance. The results of the survey conclude that quantitative metrics \\r\\nsuch as the number of incidents handled and time from detection to \\r\\ncontainment to eradication are the most common. The three least com-\\r\\nmonly deployed metrics were “Losses accrued vs. losses prevented,” \\r\\n“Monetary cost per incident,” and “Avoidability of the incident,” all \\r\\nof which are relatively difficult to implement. Out of the metrics men-\\r\\ntioned, there were a few metrics that are relevant for measuring the \\r\\ntechnical performance of the SOC, which are “Threat actor attribution,” \\r\\n“Thoroughness of eradication,” and “Thoroughness and accuracy of en-\\r\\nterprise sweeping.”\\r\\nLogsign (2020)groups recommended metrics into two categories, \\r\\nmetrics for security operations and metrics related to business require-\\r\\nments. The number of security incidents was raised as the most impor-\\r\\ntant metric for security operations. It also depicted metrics, such as the \\r\\nnumber of alerts per analyst, the number of alerts closed by automa-\\r\\ntion, the number of false-positive alerts, and the average time to detect \\r\\na security incident.\\r\\nA blog post by Simos and Dellinger (2019)presented some of the key \\r\\nmetrics used at the Microsoft SOC. These include time to acknowledge, \\r\\ntime to remediate, escalation between tiers, and the number of inci-\\r\\ndents remediated grouped per response type (manual or automated). \\r\\nThe metrics are mostly about measuring the response capabilities of the \\r\\nSOC and are highly relevant to the technical performance of the SOC.\\r\\nIn addition to SOC-specific frameworks and methodologies, several \\r\\npublications describe ways of measuring information security on a gen-\\r\\neral level. The Performance Measurement Guide for Information Secu-\\r\\nrity (NIST SP 800-55) describes how the organization can create, select \\r\\nand implement metrics for monitoring the state of the security pro-\\r\\ngram on an overall level (Chew et al., 2008). The ISO/IEC 27004:2016 \\r\\nstandard describes guidelines that can be utilized for measuring the ef-\\r\\nfectiveness of the information security management system (ISO/IEC \\r\\n27004:2016, 2016).\\r\\nSalmi (2018)surveyed information security metrics implemented in \\r\\nlarge Finnish corporations. He identified 28 security metrics categorized \\r\\ninto either management, operational, or technical metrics. The study \\r\\ncontained no metrics that directly relate to the technical performance \\r\\nof a SOC. However, several metrics are closely related to the typical \\r\\nactivities of the SOC, such as the business impact of security incidents, \\r\\ncharacteristics of security incidents, and system vulnerabilities.\\r\\nAs a summary of SOC metrics, Table1describes the top thirty most \\r\\ncommonly mentioned metrics in the literature, i.e., the number aster-\\r\\nisks depict how many articles the metric was mentioned in. A full list of \\r\\nthe metrics observed has been published in Mendeley Data (Forsberg, \\r\\n2023). In Table1, one of the metrics was combined into a general-\\r\\nized term instead of having two separate rows for “time to resolution” \\r\\nand “time to incident closure.” Another general level observation was \\r\\nthat the terminology does not appear to be consistent in the literature. \\r\\nFor example, the metric “mean time to detect” is used to describe at \\r\\nleast two different behaviors, the time it takes to react and perform the \\r\\nanalysis of the alert (Ahlm, 2021; Agyepong et al., 2020; Crowley and \\r\\nPescatore, 2019) and time it takes for a SOC to become aware of the in-\\r\\ncident (Logsign, 2020; Vielberth et al., 2020). Some of the publications \\r\\ndid not provide enough information to clearly distinguish between the \\r\\ntwo (Kokulu et al., 2019; Zimmerman and Crowley, 2019). However, \\r\\nVielberth et al. (2020)provided a separate metric for the average analy-\\r\\nsis time and detection time. Thus a conclusion could be reached that the \\r\\ncorrect definition of time to detect metric would be the time between \\r\\nthe initial activity of the adversary and the first detection caused by the \\r\\nactivities. This viewpoint is also supported by the Computer Security \\r\\nIncident Handling Guide (NIST SP 800-61, Cichonski et al. (2012)).\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"tSrS3CPMuv/lU0uKl8aYvZH8t77YhoFAkZz+don6VVI=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_5\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nComputers & Security 135 (2023) 103529\\r\\n5\\r\\nJ.ForsbergandT.Frantti\\r\\nTable1\\r\\nTop 30 metrics in the literature.\\r\\nChewetal.(\\r\\n2008\\r\\n)\\r\\nISO/IEC27004:2016(\\r\\n2016\\r\\n)\\r\\nSalmi(\\r\\n2018\\r\\n)\\r\\nVielberthetal.(\\r\\n2020\\r\\n)\\r\\nNathans(\\r\\n2014\\r\\n)\\r\\nKeltanen(\\r\\n2019\\r\\n)\\r\\nAgyepongetal.(\\r\\n2020\\r\\n)\\r\\nKokuluetal.(\\r\\n2019\\r\\n)\\r\\nOnwubiko(\\r\\n2015\\r\\n)\\r\\nAlahmadietal.(\\r\\n2022\\r\\n)\\r\\nCrowleyandPescatore(\\r\\n2019\\r\\n)\\r\\nAhlm(\\r\\n2021\\r\\n)\\r\\nLogsign(\\r\\n2020\\r\\n)\\r\\nSimosandDellinger(\\r\\n2019\\r\\n)\\r\\nZimmermanandCrowley(\\r\\n2019\\r\\n)\\r\\nNumberofsecurityincidents  *****   ***   ***Meantimetoreaction                      *   *   *            *   *   *   *\\r\\nNumberofvulnerabilities      *   *   *   *   *         *                     *False-positiverate              ***      **   **\\r\\nMeantimetodetect                *         *   *            *   *      *Meantimetoresolution            *         *      *         *   *         *\\r\\nCostofsecurityincidents         *      *      *               *   *Detectionspercategory         *         *                     *   *\\r\\nMeantimetovulnerabilityremedy            *   *         *                  *Numberofvulnerabledevices          *   *   **\\r\\nPercentageofemployeestrained   *   *   *Percentageofstandardsystems    *   *   *\\r\\nAnalystproductivity                ***Coverageofvulnerabilityscanning      *   **\\r\\nDowntimeduetosecurityincidents        ***Incidentavoidability                   *                  *            *\\r\\nIncidentswithbusiness-impact             ***Meantimetocontainment**   *\\r\\nMeantimetotriage                *   **Numberofincidentspershift             *         *            *\\r\\nNumberofmonitoredassets           *   **Numberofpatchedvulnerabilities   *      **\\r\\nNumberofriskperseverity        *   *   *ResolutionSLAbreaches         *   *      *\\r\\nSeverityofsecurityincidents              *            *            *Threatactorattribution               *                     *            *\\r\\nNumberofautomatedincidents**Meantimetoescalation**\\r\\nQualityoferadication**ReactionSLAbreaches      **\\r\\nThe most common metric was the total number of security incidents, \\r\\nwhich was mentioned in eleven of the fifteen publications included in \\r\\nTable1. This is not a surprise, given the number of incidents is men-\\r\\ntioned as a specific metric in both NIST SP 800-53 and ISO/IEC 27004. \\r\\nIt is a metric that can easily be collected and used outside of the scope \\r\\nof SOC. Vulnerability-related metrics are also relatively common, with \\r\\nthe count of vulnerabilities being mentioned in seven publications. The \\r\\nmean time to vulnerability remediation and the count of vulnerable de-\\r\\nvices were mentioned in four publications. Operative metrics, such as \\r\\nmean time to reaction, detection, resolution, containment, triage, and \\r\\nescalation, were also commonly mentioned. The publications also con-\\r\\ntained a few technical performance metrics. They were false-positive \\r\\nrate, threat actor attribution, the number of security incidents closed \\r\\nwith automation, and the quality of eradication.\\r\\nThe literature review emphasizes the need for a common framework \\r\\nthat could be used for the performance evaluation of SOCs globally. The \\r\\nmetrics presented in Table1are scattered broadly, and there appears \\r\\nto be no common group of key metrics used to measure the tech-\\r\\nnical performance of a SOC. The published literature mostly focuses \\r\\non operational SOC or general security metrics. Although commercial \\r\\nwhitepapers provide slightly better technical performance metrics, they \\r\\nfall short in several ways. For example, the lack of proper justifica-\\r\\ntion is seen throughout them. Despite the limited scientific research on \\r\\nthe subject, several studies have reached a similar conclusion (Agye-\\r\\npong et al., 2020; Keltanen, 2019; Kokulu et al., 2019; Vielberth et al., \\r\\n2020). The lack of standard technical performance metrics could be at-\\r\\ntributed to the lack of a sufficiently mature governance model for SOCs, \\r\\nas pointed out by Vielberth et al. (2020).\\r\\n4.4. Other work on measuring SOCs\\r\\nIn addition to the literature mentioned earlier, there are several \\r\\npublications on the ways to measure SOCs. For example, Jacobs et al. \\r\\n(2013), Van Os (2016)and Schlette et al. (2021)are proposing to mea-\\r\\nsure SOCs based on a capability maturity model, Schinagl et al. (2015)\\r\\napproaches the assessment through a set of questions to understand the \\r\\nperceived level of effectiveness and Rosso et al. (2022)introduces a way \\r\\nto measure SOCs performance by injecting simulated attacks into an op-\\r\\nerational SOC and utilize pre-existing metrics to determine the level of \\r\\neffectiveness.\\r\\nAll of these methods suffer from the same fundamental problem: \\r\\nthey do not provide concrete metrics a SOC can be measured with. The \\r\\nmethod proposed by Rosso et al. (2022)succeeds in measuring the tech-\\r\\nnical performance of SOCs, but relies on existing metrics to do so. Some \\r\\nstudies discuss methodologies and provide concrete metrics to measure \\r\\nthe SOC performance, such as the papers by Shah et al. (2018)and \\r\\nAgyepong et al. (2023), but as they focus on the operational aspects \\r\\nof the SOC, they do not provide ways to measure the technical perfor-\\r\\nmance of SOCs.\\r\\n5. Solution objectives\\r\\nThe objective of the solution is the documentation of an approach \\r\\nfor creating SOC-related metrics.

Based on the \\r\\nliterature review, the requirements for the solution are the following:\\r\\n1. A selection criteria for the creation of metrics should be well-\\r\\ndefined.\\r\\n2. A separate quality criteria for the metrics should be defined and \\r\\nthe metrics created with the framework should conform with it.\\r\\n3. The metrics should be directly associated with a specific SOC func-\\r\\ntion.\\r\\n4. The metrics should be universal and not tied to a specific technol-\\r\\nogy or an organizational structure.\\r\\n5. The metrics should be justified either by scientific research, indus-\\r\\ntry standards, or through other means that considerably decrease \\r\\nthe subjectivity of the metrics.\\r\\nThe justification for the objective 1 is that there does not appear to \\r\\nbe an industry-standard framework for creating metrics for SOCs. There \\r\\nare selection criteria such as S.M.A.R.T. (Doran, 1981) and PRAGMATIC \\r\\n(Brotby and Hinson, 2013), but the criteria remain subjective at best. \\r\\nCreating a comprehensive framework for measuring the performance of \\r\\na SOC is out of the scope of this research, and the focus is placed on \\r\\nenabling the creation of selection criteria that can be used as a part of \\r\\na comprehensive framework.\\r\\nThe justification for the objective 2 is that low quality metrics \\r\\ncan produce unwanted results, as discussed in section4.2. Further-\\r\\nmore, based on the authors’ first-hand experience, many of the metrics \\r\\nused for measuring SOC are of low quality, particularly regarding bias \\r\\nand objectivity. This viewpoint is partially supported by Kokulu et al. \\r\\n(2019). However, the quality aspect of the metrics was not discussed in \\r\\ndetail in the SOC-related literature to form a valid conclusion about the \\r\\ninsufficient quality. To ensure the resulting metrics are of high quality, \\r\\nquality criteria for SOC metrics should be defined.\\r\\nThe justification for the objectives 3 and 4 is the same, which is the \\r\\nuniversal applicability of the resulting metrics. In practice, this means \\r\\nthe metrics should be usable by most SOCs out there, provided that they \\r\\ninclude the function to which the metric is tied. Finally, the justification \\r\\nfor the objective 5 is that the metrics in some situations do not appear to \\r\\nbe backed up by scientific research, particularly regarding commercial \\r\\nsources, which means the metrics are purely based on the authority of \\r\\nthe author.\\r\\n6. The metric creation framework\\r\\nThis section presents the creation of the design science artifact, i.e., \\r\\na metric creation framework. It can be used to construct metrics used to \\r\\nmeasure the performance of a SOC. The artifact is evaluated by utilizing \\r\\nit to create metrics to measure the technical performance of the SOC.\\r\\nThe metric construction model is based on requirements defined in \\r\\ntwo separate stages, as depicted in Fig.3. The first stage consists of the \\r\\nsolution objectives, and the second stage is the metric creation frame-\\r\\nwork that consists of the requirements the metric should conform to \\r\\nand the characteristics that must be describable in the metric documen-\\r\\ntation, see Fig.4.\\r\\nA valid metric must fulfill both the metric requirements and the \\r\\ncharacteristics. The metric requirements are:\\r\\n1. The metric has a clear and well-defined goal.\\r\\n2. The owner of the metric is clear.\\r\\n3. The results are not dependent on third parties.\\r\\n4. The metric can be justified.\\r\\n5. The metric is tied to a success factor.\\r\\n6. The metric is aligned with the quality criteria.\\r\\nA well-defined goal means the metric must be meaningful as per the \\r\\nquality criteria by Savola (2013)and the PRAGMATIC methodology by \\r\\nBrotby and Hinson (2013). The quality criteria within the context of a \\r\\nSOC are shown in Table2.\\r\\nThe metric should also be assignable directly to a function within a \\r\\nSOC. If a third party influences the metric, the metric does not measure \\r\\nonly the performance of the SOC but rather the entire chain related to \\r\\nthreat detection and incident response.\\r\\nThe metrics should also be justifiable by scientific research, industry \\r\\nstandards, or through other means documented in the metric descrip-\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"dmjlYf/VVAzujLLP1h+3CJwkKyFm3AipeRUEqnfJUOA=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_7":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_7\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":7,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nComputers & Security 135 (2023) 103529\\r\\n7\\r\\nJ.ForsbergandT.Frantti\\r\\nTable2\\r\\nThe quality criteria for the SOC metrics.\\r\\nCriteria     CharacteristicDescription\\r\\nCorrectnessGranularityThe metric should provide the necessary granularity to tie the metric to a specific function or team within a SOC.CompletenessThe metric should completely fulfill the goal defined in the metric documentation. If the metric cannot alone fill the goal, \\r\\nthe metric should be coupled together with another metric.ObjectiveandunbiasedThe results should not be influenced by the activities performed by the person setting up the metric and the bias should be \\r\\nminimized to acceptable levels defined in the metric description.\\r\\nMeasurabilityAvailabilityMeasurements used to construct the metric must be automatically available in a reliable and consistent format.ReproducibilityThe metric must be reproducible by different persons across multiple organizations given access to the same measurements.\\r\\nMeaningfulnessImpactfulThe metric must have an impact on the daily activities and it must be capable of showing the progression of development efforts.\\r\\nClarityThe interpretation of the metric must be unambiguous and consistent across the entire lifecycle of the metric.ComparabilityThe result of the metric must aim to be comparable between multiple SOCs even between organizations.\\r\\nUsabilityPortabilityThe metric must be usable by multiple different SOCs and not be dependent on their size, structure, service model, or parent organization.\\r\\nControllabilityThe team the metric is used to measure must be capable of keeping the metric value between the expected values.ScalabilityThe metric must be able to behave consistently with low and high volumes of measurements.\\r\\nPresentableIt must be possible to present the information the metric is expected to provide visually.\\r\\ntion. If the metrics are justifiable, there is no need to rely on the \\r\\nauthority of the source.\\r\\nEstablishing a connection between the indicator and the critical suc-\\r\\ncess factors (CSFs) is a fundamental requirement for key performance \\r\\nindicators (KPIs) as described in the book by Parmenter (2019). On a \\r\\npractical level, establishing a connection between the CSFs and the KPIs \\r\\nforces organizations to identify critical contributors to organizational \\r\\nperformance and thus qualify to be measured with the KPIs. Finally, \\r\\nthe metric should conform to the quality criteria, Table2.\\r\\nIf the metric has passed the requirements, it can be constructed. \\r\\nThe metric can have different characteristics depending on variables, \\r\\nsuch as which SOC function it relates to or the stakeholders the metric \\r\\ntargets. The fundamental characteristics that should always be defined \\r\\nare the following:\\r\\n1. Target audience and intended use\\r\\n2. Measures to reduce bias and subjectivity\\r\\n3. Required additional contextual information\\r\\n4. Required measurements\\r\\n5. Format for the presentation of the metric\\r\\n6. Interpretation instructions\\r\\nThe target audience of the metrics and the intended use must be well de-\\r\\nfined because there is a mismatch between the evaluation metrics when \\r\\nit comes to SOC managers, SOC analysts, and other technical personnel \\r\\n(Kokulu et al., 2019).\\r\\nIf we can reduce bias to a minimum and ensure the metric is objec-\\r\\ntive, we can fulfill the most important quality criterion, correctness.\\r\\nThere can also be situations where a counter-metric or other addi-\\r\\ntional contextual information is needed. For example, a SOC may have a \\r\\nmetric to measure the number of distinct monitoring rules, which could \\r\\nbe used to measure the detection potential of the SOC. However, the \\r\\nhigh number of monitoring rules does not directly correlate with the \\r\\nperformance of the SOC, since if a majority of the security incidents re-\\r\\nsulting from the monitoring rules are false-positive, the SOC is unlikely \\r\\nto be able to handle them effectively (Alahmadi et al., 2022). There-\\r\\nfore, the metric for the number of monitoring rules should be coupled \\r\\nwith the false-positive rate to measure the effective detection potential.\\r\\nAs the metrics consist of measurements, the source for the measure-\\r\\nment data must be defined along with the format of measurement, the \\r\\nmeasurement interval, and any other information that affects the mea-\\r\\nsurements or metrics in any way. For example, a metric measuring the \\r\\nmean time to resolution would require each security incident to have \\r\\ntwo measurements, one to measure the time when the incident was \\r\\nopened and another one to measure the time when the incident has \\r\\nbeen resolved.\\r\\nMetrics must also be presented in such a way that they clearly and \\r\\nconsistently depict the information the metric is supposed to deliver. \\r\\nFor example, the metric can be presented numerically, by various charts \\r\\nor time series graphs, or in a text format within a table. The way the \\r\\nmetric is presented should provide the person interpreting the metric \\r\\nwith the necessary information to make decisions based on the data \\r\\nseen.\\r\\nInterpreting the metrics is important in ensuring the metrics provide \\r\\nvaluable insights for the stakeholders. Although the fundamental idea is \\r\\nthat the metrics themselves should be self-explanatory, in the practical \\r\\nsense, some metrics can be hard to interpret. The metric documentation \\r\\nshould include the expected way to interpret the results.\\r\\n7. Metrics for security operations center\\r\\nThis section describes how the metrics meet the objectives defined \\r\\nin the metric creation framework. Measurements used to construct the \\r\\nmetrics have been programmatically generated and presented using \\r\\nopen-source tools and Python modules, most prominently Jupyter Note-\\r\\nbooks4and a Python graphing library Plotly.5Additionally, scikit-learn, \\r\\nwhich is a Python module that can be used for data analysis and ma-\\r\\nchine learning algorithm development (Pedregosa et al., 2011), was \\r\\nused to calculate the statistical fitting of a trend line in the form of \\r\\nlinear regression. The parameters for creating the data points are ad-\\r\\njusted every 100 steps to create variation in the results over time. The \\r\\nsource code for the metrics is published in Mendeley Data (Forsberg, \\r\\n2023).\\r\\n7.1. Distribution of detections among the UKC\\r\\nDistribution of detections among the Unified Kill Chain (UKC)measures \\r\\nhow effective the SOC is in detecting threats in the early stages of the \\r\\nUKC and thus decreases the impact of a security incident. The metric \\r\\nis tied to a function responsible for custom analytics and detection cre-\\r\\nation, as per the definition by Knerler et al. (2022). If the SOC does not \\r\\nhave a team responsible for the function, the metric is not measuring \\r\\nthe performance of a SOC but rather the tools the SOC is using. In that \\r\\ncase, the metric depends on third parties and thus is not a valid metric \\r\\nfor a SOC.\\r\\nFig.5depicts a visual representation of the metric with a detection \\r\\nstrategy focused on the initial foothold stage.

Fig.6depicts \\r\\nthe metric with a detection distribution focused on network propaga-\\r\\ntion. Both strategies statistically have a similar amount of detections \\r\\nin the final phase of the kill chain. Thus, both are equally effective in \\r\\npreventing adversaries from achieving their objectives. However, the \\r\\nstrategy focusing on the initial foothold stage is better in terms of the \\r\\nmetric, as it is more effective at preventing the incidents from traversing \\r\\nforward within the UKC.\\r\\nFig.5also shows that the value of the linear regression coefficient \\r\\ndecreases over time, meaning the detection strategy shows signs of im-\\r\\nprovement. By contrast, the trend is increasing in Fig.6, showing signs \\r\\nof deterioration. Both figures display a large variation at the beginning \\r\\nof the metric, which means the metric is not accurate until there is a \\r\\nsufficient quantity of true-positive detections, but otherwise, the metric \\r\\nconforms with the requirements defined by the framework.\\r\\n7.2. Number of verifiable monitoring rules\\r\\nThe metric Number of verifiable monitoring rulesmeasures the share \\r\\nof monitoring rules that can be automatically or manually verified by \\r\\nexecuting actions that trigger the rules. The goal of the metric is to im-\\r\\nprove the verification rate of the monitoring rules, encourage detection \\r\\nengineers, who are responsible for the creation of the detection capabil-\\r\\nities, to better utilize threat intelligence as a part of their daily routines, \\r\\nand provide a means for a SOC to demonstrate what attacks they can \\r\\ndetect. The metric is tied to a function responsible for custom analyt-\\r\\nics and detection creation, and it is valid only if the SOC has a team \\r\\nresponsible for it.\\r\\nThe metric output is not affected by external conditions and meets \\r\\nthe clarity and scalability characteristics of the quality criteria.

The bar chart displays the number of distinct \\r\\nmonitoring rules and the sum of verifiable monitoring rules per MITRE \\r\\nATT&CK tactic. Next to the bars is a trend line displaying the percentage \\r\\nof verifiable monitoring rules. The value of the metric is the mean of the \\r\\npercentage of the monitoring rules covered per MITRE ATT&CK tactic \\r\\nat a given time. The intended way to interpret the metric is to follow \\r\\nthe trend of the mean to determine whether the SOC is improving over \\r\\ntime.\\r\\nFor the metric to provide meaningful information, it needs a \\r\\ncounter-metric that displays the number of distinct monitoring rules, \\r\\nas shown in the blue bars in Fig.7. If the SOC has a low number of \\r\\nmonitoring rules, the metric value can be abnormally high, increas-\\r\\ning bias and decreasing the comparability of results between different \\r\\nSOCs. The number of monitoring rules can also be misleading, as there \\r\\nis a possibility of creating many low-fidelity monitoring rules.\\r\\nAs the metric measures only the number of verifiable monitoring \\r\\nrules resulting from the SOC development efforts, it fails to demonstrate \\r\\nthe verification capabilities of native vendor detections. This makes the \\r\\nmetric subjective, as some SOCs are likely to rely more on native capa-\\r\\nbilities for threat detection than others, making the metric inefficient \\r\\nfor comparing metric values from one SOC to one another, even if their \\r\\noperative models would be similar. A dimension that displays the num-\\r\\nber of vendor-native detections that can be tested could be added to \\r\\nthe metric. However, doing so would increase the bias of the metric. \\r\\nA better solution would be to create a separate metric for measuring \\r\\nthe number of verifiable vendor-native scenarios and construct another \\r\\nmetric that considers both metrics. The metric is not considered to be \\r\\nvalid in terms of the metric creation framework, as the metric is highly \\r\\nsubjective and overly biased.\\r\\n7.3. Distribution of detections by source\\r\\nDistribution of detections by sourcemetric determines to what extent \\r\\nthe development efforts of a SOC can contribute to the detection of \\r\\nsecurity incidents. On a practical level, if a large portion of detections \\r\\noriginates from the native capabilities of the technologies in use, the \\r\\ndetection engineering function may not be able to provide additional \\r\\nvalue in the form of new monitoring rules. The metric can be tied to \\r\\na specific function, which is responsible for creating custom analytics \\r\\nwithin the SOC. The metric results are somewhat dependent on third \\r\\nparties, as the technologies selected to protect the environment have an \\r\\nimpact on the metric results. However, as the fundamental purpose is \\r\\nto compare the custom capabilities against the native capabilities, the \\r\\nmetric is not dependent on third parties but rather influenced by them, \\r\\nmaking the metric pass the requirement.\\r\\nKnerler et al. (2022)state that custom analytics and custom capa-\\r\\nbility development are the functional areas of the SOC. Hence, it can \\r\\nbe argued that the capability to augment the detection capabilities \\r\\nprovided natively by the technologies is a success factor for the SOC. \\r\\nOverall, SOC-related literature does not succeed well in defining why \\r\\ncustom analytics should be created in the first place. For example, Kn-\\r\\nerler et al. (2022); Ahlm (2021); Van Os (2016); Vielberth et al. (2020)\\r\\nmentioned the creation of monitoring rules as a fundamental part of \\r\\nSOC capabilities. However, none are discussing in detail whether the \\r\\ncreation of monitoring rules is something the SOC should focus on or \\r\\nnot. Moreover, as the literature appears to agree that the creation of \\r\\nmonitoring rules is something SOCs should be doing, it acts as a justi-\\r\\nfication for the metric. The metric can also be justified by displaying \\r\\nwhether it makes sense to invest in the development of custom capabil-\\r\\nities or not.\\r\\nWith MITRE ATT&CK tactic as the primary dimension for the metric, \\r\\nsee Fig.8, the metric provides a method for the detection engineering \\r\\nfunction to align and focus their development efforts on specific tactics. \\r\\nFurthermore, SOC management can also benefit from the metric, as the \\r\\nvalue of the metric over time can be used to determine the direction and \\r\\nthe impact of changes made within the detection engineering team and \\r\\nsubsequently demonstrate the value the detection engineering function \\r\\nprovides.\\r\\nCertain limitations must be imposed on the metric to reduce subjec-\\r\\ntivity and bias. Within the context of this metric, detections originating \\r\\nfrom native capabilities are something that some technology, for exam-\\r\\nple, SIEM, EDR, or an IDS, has provided the first indication of compro-\\r\\nmise with out-of-the-box capabilities and without correlation to other \\r\\ndata sources. This means that if the source of the detection is an alert \\r\\nfrom an IDS or anti-virus program, it constitutes a native detection. \\r\\nHowever, if the anti-virus alert correlates with other endpoint-related \\r\\nlogs before generating a detection, it is a custom capability. All detec-\\r\\ntions that have been contained automatically and do not require further \\r\\nactions from the SOC, such as an anti-virus program or an IDS prevent-\\r\\ning an infection or the delivery of a malicious payload, are out-of-scope \\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"vrlXB6WrI/Rfc+oIPGjeWT/cT9g5je9OjcgabrjsrhY=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_10":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_10\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":10,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nComputers & Security 135 (2023) 103529\\r\\n10\\r\\nJ.ForsbergandT.Frantti\\r\\nFig.8.Distributionofdetectionspersource(TP=true-positiveandTP-B=benigntrue-positive).\\r\\nfor this metric. Furthermore, all false-positive detections and detections \\r\\nnot originating either from a technology or a monitoring rule, such as \\r\\nreports from end-users, are also removed from the measurements of the \\r\\nmetric, as they are unnecessary for achieving the goal of the metric.\\r\\nTo construct the metric, the source for the detection, in addition to \\r\\nMITRE ATT&CK categorization, must be recorded for all true-positive \\r\\nand benign true-positive detections. One way to present the metric is \\r\\nseen in Fig.8, which displays two charts. A bar chart displaying, for \\r\\neach MITRE ATT&CK tactic and an unclassified category, the current \\r\\nstate of the metric in terms of the number of detections per category, \\r\\nand the ratio between native and custom detections. Additionally, the \\r\\nmetric displays a line graph on a secondary y-axis depicting the score \\r\\nfor each tactic and the overall value of the metric, which is the mean of \\r\\nthe scores for each category. The line graph displays the evolution of the \\r\\nvalue of the metric over time, along with a linear regression depicting \\r\\nthe trend of it.\\r\\n7.4. Technical accuracy of the analysis\\r\\nThe quality of the analysis work is subjective, and it is unlikely to \\r\\nbe possible to measure with a general-purpose metric. However, mea-\\r\\nsuring the accuracy of the analysis could provide some hints about the \\r\\nquality. One possible way to calculate the accuracy of the analysis is to \\r\\nadopt an approach similar to the calculation of the net-promoter score \\r\\n(NPS), which can be used to measure customer satisfaction (Reichheld, \\r\\n2004). In NPS, customers score a service on a range from 0 to 10, where \\r\\nscores 0-6 are detractors, 7-8 are passive, and 9-10 are promoters. The \\r\\nNPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the \\r\\npercentage of promoters, providing a score between -100 and 100. The \\r\\nformula is 푁푃푆=(푃1−퐷푃1+푃2+퐷) ∗ 100where 푃1are number of promoters, \\r\\n푃2are the number of passives and 퐷are the number of detractors. Al-\\r\\nthough in the academic sense, the NPS methodology has some issues for \\r\\nwhat it is being used for (Bendle et al., 2019), the model succeeds in \\r\\nproducing a value of the relationship of discouraged (detractors), neu-\\r\\ntral (passives), and encouraged (promoters) activities, and as such, it is \\r\\na valid and relatively simple approach to take. Identifying proper meth-\\r\\nods to measure the quality of the security analysis would be a valuable \\r\\ntopic for additional research.\\r\\nTable3summarizes the activities. Promoters are activities that \\r\\nshould be encouraged to be performed continuously and are signs of \\r\\na well-performing SOC, passives are expected from a SOC under normal \\r\\nTable3\\r\\nGrouping of activities per NPS category.\\r\\nCategory  Activity\\r\\nPromoters True-positiveincidentwasescalatedtothird-party.EscalatedincidentwasnotreturnedtoSOCforfurtherinvestigation.\\r\\nOriginalprioritywascorrectthroughouttheincidentlifecycle.Nounknownentitiesbeforeescalation.\\r\\nPassives  Benigntrue-positiveincidentwasescalated.EscalatedincidentwasreturnedtoSOCforfurtherinvestigation.\\r\\nPriorityofthesecurityincidentwasadjustedaftertheinitialanalysis.Unknownentitiesbeforeescalation.\\r\\nTheinitialconclusiononthereturnedincidentwascorrect.\\r\\nDetractors False-positiveincidentwasescalated.False-negativedetection.\\r\\nTheinitialconclusiononareturnedincidentwasincorrect.\\r\\noperations and detractors are activities that the SOC should attempt to \\r\\navoid, as they can harm the overall situation.\\r\\nThe metric can be justified by the idea that if the analysis is of low \\r\\nquality or the quality decreases over time, the SOC might not be able \\r\\nto combat the challenges produced by a modern-day adversary, or they \\r\\nmight not have sufficient knowledge of the monitored environment. The \\r\\nsame idea could be considered to be a success factor for the SOC. The \\r\\nmetric is more intended for the management of the SOC as they are \\r\\nlikely to be more interested in the overall situation rather than focus \\r\\non specific metrics. The measurements required to construct the metric \\r\\nvary depending on the activities chosen for the metric.\\r\\nThe metric can be presented similarly to the other metrics; see Fig.9. \\r\\nThe bar chart depicts the count of activity occurrences for each category \\r\\n(promoters, passives, detractors) per MITRE ATT&CK tactic. If there are \\r\\nzero items, the tactic is omitted. The NPS is also displayed individually \\r\\nfor each MITRE ATT&CK tactic to demonstrate the difference in the \\r\\ntechnical accuracy of the analysis between tactics. Due to the way the \\r\\nNPS is calculated, the actual value of the metric must be calculated from \\r\\nall occurrences of the activities, rather than taking the average of the \\r\\nindividual NPS. The secondary graph in Fig.9depicts the evolution of \\r\\nthe NPS over time and a linear regression that demonstrates the trend \\r\\nof the evolution of the metric. If the NPS is above 0, it means there are \\r\\nmore promoters than detractors, and as such, the higher the score, the \\r\\nbetter the metric value is. The metric works as a standalone metric.

Model validation\\r\\nMetrics are evaluated within a SOC that provides managed SOC \\r\\nservices to large and medium enterprises. The metrics are judged by \\r\\nevaluation criteria: “Can the measurements required to construct the met-\\r\\nric be collected within the SOC used as the test subject?”.\\r\\nThe demonstration of metrics with live data could also have been a \\r\\nvalid evaluation metric for the metrics, but due to the metrics requiring \\r\\nhistorical data to provide information other than a snapshot of the cur-\\r\\nrent state, the evaluation would require a longer period to be properly \\r\\nevaluated. In this research, the metrics have been tested with simulated \\r\\ndata during the creation process and the expectation is that the metrics \\r\\nbehave similarly when real-world measurements are used as a source \\r\\nfor the metrics.\\r\\nBefore implementing the metrics, it is necessary to understand \\r\\nwhich measurements are required to construct the metrics and whether \\r\\nthey can be collected or not. Out of the metrics generated, the metrics \\r\\nthat were determined to be valid were distribution of detections among the \\r\\nunified kill chain, distribution of detections by source, and technical accu-\\r\\nracy of the analysis. The metric number of verifiable monitoring ruleswas \\r\\nconsidered to be invalid by the criteria defined by the metric creation \\r\\nframework. The following section briefly discusses the measurements \\r\\nfor the metrics that are considered to be valid.\\r\\nThe SOC is utilizing a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Re-\\r\\nsponse (SOAR) platform to manage the security incident management \\r\\nworkflows. In this particular SOC, the SOAR platform collects all detec-\\r\\ntions into a single pane of glass in the form of cases, which unifies the \\r\\nanalyst workflows across different environments and security products. \\r\\nThe SOAR platform also produces a significant portion of the measure-\\r\\nments needed to construct metrics used to measure the performance of \\r\\nthe SOC.\\r\\nDetections have MITRE ATT&CK tactic classification, which means \\r\\nthat the MITRE ATT&CK tactic can be successfully utilized in multiple \\r\\nmetrics. Furthermore, as the UKC is closely associated with the MITRE \\r\\nATT&CK framework, the UKC stage can be partially derived from the \\r\\nMITRE ATT&CK tactic. The detection source is also available in the \\r\\nplatform but is currently not extracted. All detections and resulting se-\\r\\ncurity incidents are classified on a high level either as false-positive, \\r\\ntrue-positive, or benign true-positive. All cases have a default prior-\\r\\nity, which depends on the priority of the associated detections, but the \\r\\npriority can change as the investigation process moves forward. The \\r\\noriginal and the final priority are also recorded in the SOAR platform.\\r\\nA pivotal part of the daily SOC operations is the escalation of \\r\\ntrue-positive or benign true-positive detection as security incidents to \\r\\nvarious stakeholders, for example, a customer or a dedicated incident \\r\\nresponse team. The escalation status can be derived from the escalation \\r\\ntarget group, but it is not explicitly recorded in the SOAR platform.\\r\\nAs a part of the investigation workflows, the SOC is attempting to \\r\\nresolve unknown entities that are associated with the detection. For \\r\\nexample, an IP address without a hostname associated is an unknown \\r\\nentity. Known entities are extracted to cases from the detections, but the \\r\\nunknown entities identified by the SOC are not recorded in any particu-\\r\\nlar field other than free-text case notes. This causes the state of unknown \\r\\nentities to not be reliably available in the SOAR platform. It could be \\r\\npossible to construct a workflow that reminds analysts to record the un-\\r\\nknown entities on the case. However, as there is a human reliance on \\r\\nthe activity, if the data cannot be reliably and automatically collected, \\r\\nit can violate the availability characteristic of the quality criteria and \\r\\ncause the metric to become biased.\\r\\nInformation about the accuracy of the initial conclusion and whether \\r\\nthe SOC had to re-investigate the security incident can be produced \\r\\nas a part of the workflows used to manage the security incidents. If \\r\\nthe incident has to be re-opened, it is an indication that the SOC had \\r\\nto re-investigate the incident. The accuracy of the initial conclusion \\r\\nis confirmed by the analyst when the case is closed.

On an overall level, the remaining metrics suffered \\r\\nfrom similar issues, as reducing bias and subjectivity was difficult to \\r\\nperform, and the entire definition of what is an acceptable level of bias \\r\\nor subjectivity remained relatively subjective as well.\\r\\nThe valid metrics created with the framework can help SOCs to \\r\\npush their detection capabilities more towards the earlier stages of the \\r\\nunified cyber kill chain to decrease the potential impact of the secu-\\r\\nrity incidents (Distribution of detections among the UKC), quantify the \\r\\nvalue of their detection engineering function (Distribution of detections \\r\\nby source) and provide insights on the activities performed as a part \\r\\nof the analysis process (Technical accuracy of the analysis). While the \\r\\nmetrics are by no means comprehensive, they can be used to measure \\r\\nthe technical performance of a SOC within the respective areas, and as \\r\\nsuch, can be used to enhance the reporting capabilities related to the \\r\\ntechnical performance of the SOC, for as long as the required measure-\\r\\nments can be made available.\\r\\nOne of the limitations of this research is that the design science \\r\\nmethodology is not followed rigorously, as the feedback loop between \\r\\nthe “Evaluation” and the “Design and development” activities are not \\r\\ncompletely enforced as per the design science methodology outlined \\r\\nby Peffers et al. (2007). The decision to limit the number of iterations \\r\\nwas made due to constraints related to the research schedule and the \\r\\nfact that to properly evaluate the metrics, they would require years of \\r\\nmeasurements to be collected.\\r\\nAlthough the artifact was able to produce metrics that can be used \\r\\nto enhance the reporting capabilities of the technical performance of \\r\\na SOC, the link between the technical performance and the metric \\r\\ncreation framework could have been slightly more concrete. The frame-\\r\\nwork itself does not directly enforce the relationship between the met-\\r\\nrics and technical performance. This does not necessarily make the \\r\\ncriteria to be less useful, but it leaves the determination of whether \\r\\nthe resulting metric measures technical performance or not up to the \\r\\nuser of the artifact to decide. As an upside, the framework can also be \\r\\nused to create non-technical metrics.\\r\\nThe literature review did not establish a clear pattern when it comes \\r\\nto the availability of SOC-related metrics, and as such, a conclusion \\r\\nwas reached that no such framework currently exists. Many of the more \\r\\ncommonly used metrics as summarized in Table1are operative, such as \\r\\nnumber of security incidents, mean time to reactionand mean time to reso-\\r\\nlution. As a result, they cannot be directly used to measure the technical \\r\\nperformance of a SOC. Although it could be argued that the technical \\r\\nperformance has a direct impact on the operational performance and \\r\\nas such, the operative metrics are also an indication of the technical \\r\\nperformance. However, as the operational metrics are also influenced \\r\\nby the process and people aspects of SOC, the metrics provide incon-\\r\\nclusive results when attempting to be used to measure the technical \\r\\nperformance.\\r\\nSome of the metrics can be used to partially measure the technical \\r\\nperformance, such as the false-positive rateor number of incidents handled \\r\\nautomatically, but they are at best imperfect when evaluated with the \\r\\nmetric creation framework, due to lack of additional context that causes \\r\\nthe metric to become overly biased. For example, a high true-positive \\r\\nrate, and subsequently a low false-positive rate, can be an indication of a \\r\\nwell-performing SOC but without understanding the detection strategy \\r\\nor level of automation, the metric alone can be misleading. The SOC \\r\\ncould automatically close a majority of the false-positive and benign \\r\\ntrue-positive detections, and instead use them for threat hunting or to \\r\\nprovide additional context in the form of potentially related low-fidelity \\r\\ndetections when investigating high-severity detections. The framework \\r\\ncan be used to enhance the reporting capabilities provided by these \\r\\ntechnical metrics, as it can be used to reduce both the bias and subjec-\\r\\ntivity as well as take into account the additional contextual information \\r\\nrequired to properly interpret the metric. In-depth validation of the met-\\r\\nrics in Table1against the framework could be a suitable topic for future \\r\\nresearch.\\r\\nAdditional research should be performed to validate the framework \\r\\nto reach a definitive conclusion about the applicability of the framework \\r\\nin real-world SOC deployments. Furthermore, the academic research re-\\r\\nlated to modern SOC operations appears to also be limited and would \\r\\nrequire additional research, especially when it comes to the following \\r\\nquestions: (1) What are the technical success factors for SOCs? (2) What \\r\\nmakes an effective cyber defense program?, and (3) Should SOCs fo-\\r\\ncus more on proactive and preventative capabilities, rather than being \\r\\nmostly reactive? Answers to these questions would help with the cre-\\r\\nation of better metrics for measuring the technical performance of a \\r\\nSOC. Both academia and practitioners are encouraged to share metrics \\r\\nand ways to describe them, with the security community to enhance the \\r\\nmethods by which organizations can measure the effectiveness of their \\r\\nSOC deployment. In support of this initiative, the authors have pub-\\r\\nlished the source code for the metrics used to validate the framework \\r\\n(Forsberg, 2023).\\r\\n10. Conclusions\\r\\nThe outcome of this research further emphasizes the need for better \\r\\ncapabilities to measure the technical performance of SOCs. The com-\\r\\nmonly used metrics focus on operational activities and are inadequate \\r\\nto measure the technical performance of a SOC. Furthermore, the met-\\r\\nrics observed in the literature do not appear to be a result of a systematic \\r\\ndevelopment but rather be loosely based on generic security metrics or \\r\\notherwise based on industry best practices without significant scientific \\r\\njustification.\\r\\nThis research resulted in a design science artifact.

However, \\r\\nwhen examined in light of the developed metric creation framework, \\r\\nthese metrics were found to benefit from additional context to be more \\r\\neffectively utilized.\\r\\nAs a part of the demonstration of the artifact, four unique metrics \\r\\nwere created. Three of the four metrics were considered valid in terms \\r\\nof the metric creation framework. The metrics were validated by ver-\\r\\nifying that the measurements can be collected within a SOC service \\r\\nprovider.\\r\\nOne of the key limitations of this study is the relatively narrow se-\\r\\nlection of metrics that were used to demonstrate the framework. The \\r\\nmetrics created with the framework are mostly related to the detection \\r\\ncapabilities of the SOC, and other functions, such as threat hunting or \\r\\ncyber threat intelligence, have not been included in the metrics chosen \\r\\nfor the demonstration. Therefore, whether the framework is suitable \\r\\nfor creating technical metrics for functions other than those that work \\r\\nclosely with the security incident management process remains un-\\r\\nknown. The wider demonstration was left to be researched in the future.\\r\\nDespite the minor limitations of the research, the framework and \\r\\nthe metrics used for demonstration can be adopted by SOCs to con-\\r\\nstruct metrics they can use to measure and demonstrate their techni-\\r\\ncal capabilities. Due to the lack of industry-standard reporting schema \\r\\nfor the technical performance of SOCs, the SOC industry as a whole \\r\\nis encouraged to enable industry-driven development of the measure-\\r\\nment capabilities, be open, and share the metrics they use to measure \\r\\ntheir technical capabilities with the wider community. In addition to \\r\\nindustry-backed development of technical performance measurement, \\r\\nadditional academic research is needed on the subject.\\r\\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\\r\\nJoonas Forsberg:Researching, Writing, Reviewing and Editing.\\r\\nTapio Frantti:Supervision, Writing, Reviewing and Editing.\\r\\nDeclaration of competing interest\\r\\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial \\r\\ninterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence \\r\\nthe work reported in this paper.\\r\\nData availability\\r\\nSee ref.

This trend has sig-\\r\\nnificant implications for how Security Operations Centers\\r\\n(SOCs) manage these end devices on  their enterprise net-\\r\\nworks: in their organizational roles, regulatory environment,\\r\\nand required skills. By intersecting historical analysis (start-\\r\\ning in the 1970s) and ethnography (analyzed 352 field notes\\r\\nacross 1,000+ hours in a SOC over 34 months) whilst com-\\r\\nplementing with quantitative interviews (covering 7 other\\r\\nSOCs), we uncover causal forces that have pushed network\\r\\nmanagement toward endpoints. We further highlight the nega-\\r\\ntive impacts on end user privacy and analyst burnout. As such,\\r\\nwe assert that SOCs should consider preparing for a continual,\\r\\nlong-term shift from managing the network perimeter and the\\r\\nassociated devices to commanding the actual user endpoints\\r\\nwhile facing potential privacy challenges and more burnout.\\r\\n1  Introduction\\r\\nCOVID-19 has caused shifts in patterns of Internet use, with\\r\\nsome tied to the surge in “work from home” (WFH) users [11].\\r\\nSurvey data suggests that at least 41.8% of Americans par-\\r\\nticipated in WFH [47], and it is apparent that WFH will be-\\r\\ncome an integral part of larger organizations in the future [53].\\r\\nSecurity Operations Centers [109, 113], shorthanded SOCs,\\r\\ntend to play a central role in enabling this endeavour. SOCs\\r\\nare deployed by organizations in industry, government, and\\r\\nacademia  to  manage  their networks, defend against cyber\\r\\nthreats, and maintain regulatory compliance [109, 113].\\r\\nOur study analyzes through ethnographic and historical\\r\\nmethods the causal forces that incentivize and intensify end-\\r\\npoint security monitoring by SOCs, particularly in the context\\r\\nof a prolonged and en masse COVID-19 WFH phenomenon.\\r\\nWe see endpoint security management as themonitoring and\\r\\ndefense of client devices that possess authorized access to en-\\r\\nterprise networks and resources. These endpoints are Internet-\\r\\n§Part of this work was performed while at Stevens Institute of Technology\\r\\nconnected devices of any kind, supplied by the organization\\r\\nor the individual, and are frequently used for a mix of profes-\\r\\nsional and personal activities [1, 86].\\r\\nWhile the practice of endpoint security management is not\\r\\ncompletely new, and the proliferation of heterogeneous de-\\r\\nvices has been ongoing, we anticipate that SOCs will increas-\\r\\ningly be expected to perform these same functions with a far\\r\\nmore differentiated (by device characteristic) and distributed\\r\\n(by location) network perimeter. SOCs now bear the burden of\\r\\nmanaging a network whose boundaries are regional, national,\\r\\nor even global based upon user locality [101]. As we later\\r\\nelaborate, our study can serve as a warning to how SOCs will,\\r\\nor have already been tasked with controlling/commanding\\r\\nendpoints. Yet these responsibilities may require additional\\r\\norganizational, technical, or training support. Understanding\\r\\nthese new responsibilities as they relate to long-term end-\\r\\npoint monitoring trends, will be an important consideration\\r\\nfor future SOCs, their staff, and their organizations.\\r\\nModern endpoint security management replaces old sys-\\r\\ntems with new technologiesandnew social policies, giving\\r\\nSOC staff highly granular control over both individual end-\\r\\ndevices (e.g., patch levels, firewall rules, installed applica-\\r\\ntions) and end-users (e.g., login frequency, location, file down-\\r\\nloads) [73, 114]. This control, in turn, contributes to the brittle\\r\\nstate of endpoint security management. This brittleness can be\\r\\nattributed to an increase in vulnerability to unforeseen interac-\\r\\ntion effects than previous sociotechnical systems of security\\r\\nmanagement [106–108]. Together, they increase the degree to\\r\\nwhich SOC staff regulate professionalandpersonal Internet\\r\\nuse (media consumption and sociality more generally).\\r\\nWe employ a multi-year ethnographic analysis of a U.S.\\r\\nSOC before and during COVID-19. Based on ourinitialethno-\\r\\ngraphic observations of events, we engage in a historical study\\r\\nto trace endpoint security management backward in time —\\r\\nis COVID-19’s push towards WFH potentially another cata-\\r\\nlyst of SOCs assuming endpoint security management?

In\\r\\nturn, we analyze our ethnographic observations based upon\\r\\nthe outcomes of our historical study.\\r\\nThe move toward more powerful endpoint security mon-\\r\\nitoring  and data  handling  is  not obvious.  By  intersecting\\r\\nhistory (starting in the 1970s) with ethnography (analyzed\\r\\n352 field notes and performed two rounds of semi-structured\\r\\ninterviews across 1,000+ hours in a SOC over 34 months)\\r\\nand complementing both with a quantitative analysis (cov-\\r\\nering 7 other SOCs), we show a shift in importance for end-\\r\\npoint security monitoring.  Our ethnographic work reveals\\r\\nhow WFH-incentivized endpoint monitoring is an outcome\\r\\nof characteristics (detailed below) that are shared by many\\r\\nSOCs. Specifically, our SOC’s shared internal organizational\\r\\nand technical architecture, as well as the Internet environment\\r\\nin which it operates. Our study received IRB approval from\\r\\nour institutions and we also employed additional measures to\\r\\nprotect our participants as detailed in Section 3.4.\\r\\nThrough our analysis, we argue that COVID-19’s WFH\\r\\nshift will prove to be central to the evolution of SOCs, as\\r\\nwell as, to the Internet at large. Further, it will raise a host of\\r\\ninstitutional and procedural questions to the community not\\r\\nonly upon how the SOCs must address the increasing user\\r\\nautonomy, but do so under increased pressure in an already\\r\\nvulnerable environment contending with burnout-related chal-\\r\\nlenges [63]. This will require corollary shifts in SOC objec-\\r\\ntives and in how SOC staff are evaluated. Empirically and\\r\\nanalytically, our main contributions are as follows:\\r\\n•A novel historical analysis covering the SOC’s relationship\\r\\nwith endpoint security management resulting in the current\\r\\ntrajectories for SOC endpoint security management;\\r\\n•An ethnographic study of a U.S. SOC’s adaptation to the\\r\\nabrupt changes brought on by COVID-19 complemented\\r\\nby a permanent change to the enterprise network perimeter;\\r\\n•Identification of an increasing tension between SOC se-\\r\\ncurity practices, SOC employees, and end-user autonomy\\r\\npotentially leading to increased burnout in an already vul-\\r\\nnerable environment;\\r\\n•An extensive validation effort that includes quantitative\\r\\ninterviews  conducted with seven  other SOCs  (from  the\\r\\ngovernment sector, industry, and academia).\\r\\n2  Background and Related Work\\r\\nEndpoint security management can  be  viewed as  the  pro-\\r\\ncess to monitor and defend client (a.k.a endpoint) devices\\r\\nthat possess authorized access to enterprise networks and\\r\\nresources.  Such client devices can  be, but are not limited\\r\\nto, laptops, smartphones, tablets, Internet-Of-Things devices,\\r\\nand even small-scale managed networking devices such as\\r\\nswitches. These endpoints are Internet-connected devices of\\r\\nany kind, supplied by the organization or the individual, and\\r\\nare frequently used for a mix of professional and personal\\r\\nactivities [1, 86]. Typical functions within endpoint security\\r\\nmanagement include endpoint inventory, adjusting system\\r\\nconfigurations, restricting access through content filtering,\\r\\nand more [18]. To protect not only these endpoints but also\\r\\nthe organization’s resources, Security Operation Centers tend\\r\\nto oversee endpoint security management [31].\\r\\nSecurity Operations Centers (SOCs) are central compo-\\r\\nnents of modern enterprise networks. Organizations in indus-\\r\\ntry, government, and academia deploy SOCs to manage their\\r\\nnetworks, defend against cyber threats, and maintain regula-\\r\\ntory compliance [109, 113]. SOCs are organized in various\\r\\nways ranging from a flat structure to hierarchical tiers of ana-\\r\\nlysts, specialists, and managers [106, 107]. The structure and\\r\\nscope of the performed activities are mostly determined by\\r\\nthe organization’s size, services offered to its users, or its do-\\r\\nmain of activity. Albeit, all SOCs still perform certain core\\r\\nfunctions: incident management, monitoring and detecting\\r\\nthreats, security administration, architecture and engineering,\\r\\nand long-term planning [7, 31, 106, 118]. Just as each enter-\\r\\nprise network includes unique aspects in its configuration and\\r\\nlayout, so too are SOC tasks [106] and the maturity-level of a\\r\\nSOC [117]. Even the names that fall under the broad SOC um-\\r\\nbrella may be different across organizations e.g., Computer\\r\\nSecurity Incident Response Team (CSIRT) [29, 107], Net-\\r\\nwork Operations Center (NOC) [106], Network and Security\\r\\nOperations Center (NSOC) [108], Cybersecurity Operations\\r\\nCenter (CSOC) [48], Security and Compliance Center [106],\\r\\nManaged Security Service Provider (MSSP) [10], etc.\\r\\nPrior bodies  of  work  studied  SOCs  by  conducting  sur-\\r\\nveys [31, 101, 103, 118], interviewing analysts [7, 9, 69] or\\r\\nperforming participant observation [106–109]. These works\\r\\nuncovered various  technical problems  SOCs  face  such as\\r\\nprioritizing high numbers of opaque alerts, lack of logging,\\r\\nand assigning levels of severity to alerts [9, 31, 103].  Fur-\\r\\nthermore, other works identified sociotechnical issues such\\r\\nas analyst burnout [106], breakdowns between analysts and\\r\\nmanagers [69], and the contradictions between tools, analysts,\\r\\nand processes [108]. Our work contributes to this body of\\r\\nresearch by presenting a historical analysis on the trajectory\\r\\nof endpoint management, while also highlighting additional\\r\\nlayers of sociotechnical complexity within a SOC.\\r\\nMore recently, a few surveys measured COVID-19 and\\r\\nWFH impacts on SOCs. SIEMplify conducted a survey fo-\\r\\ncused primarily on COVID-19’s impact [101]. This survey\\r\\ncovered 393 SOC employees and asked about the effects upon\\r\\nthe security posture (26% of respondents reported a worse se-\\r\\ncurity posture), the number of alerts (42% reported increased\\r\\nalerts), and the incoming phishing emails (57% reported a\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"NkFtklH/Xg/R7jZY6L+b+RwbncYCjtoPuZQHKRwLciw=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_3":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_3\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nrise). Additionally, they find that investigating suspicious ac-\\r\\ntivities, collaborating, and communicating has become more\\r\\nchallenging in this environment. Another survey, covering 150\\r\\nsecurity and technology leaders, focused upon COVID-19’s\\r\\nWFH phenomena [16]. The majority of the respondents be-\\r\\nlieve that their current infrastructure supports WFH, and that\\r\\ntheir security posture can handle the risks. Some respondents\\r\\nreported a high volume of attacks and adopted new services\\r\\nin lieu of COVID-19 [16]. Lastly, a survey conducted by Cy-\\r\\nbersecurity Insiders across 287 cybersecurity professionals,\\r\\nfound the majority of respondents still work from home. Many\\r\\nare worried about securing network access, personal devices,\\r\\nand installed applications which pose data leakage risks, while\\r\\nsome respondents are concerned with (1) users’ exposure to\\r\\nmalware and phishing and (2) unmanaged endpoints [21, 22].\\r\\nIt is apparent that SOCs are complex structures with vary-\\r\\ning names, operations, and challenges.  It is also plausible\\r\\nthat technically analyzing a plethora of SOCs may not com-\\r\\npletely capture COVID-19’s impact. In our work, we proceed\\r\\nwith a multi-layered approach. We leverage historical anal-\\r\\nysis methods to uncover long-term trends and study a SOC\\r\\nwith anthropological approaches to help support our historical\\r\\nfindings. We further generalize our findings by conducting\\r\\nsurveys with seven other SOCs representing various sectors\\r\\n(academic, government, and industry).\\r\\n3  Methodology, Data, and Participants\\r\\nThis study leverages historical and ethnographic methodolo-\\r\\ngies to investigate a SOC’s role in  endpoint management\\r\\nwithin the context of WFH. Studying individual SOCs is the\\r\\nmain route to detailed information about their operations and\\r\\nstaff, but if used as the sole analysis, it does not permit us\\r\\nto extrapolate larger trends.  To provide an explanation of\\r\\nthe changes we now see underway, we require methods that\\r\\ncan both (1) elucidate the causal mechanisms behind SOC\\r\\noperations (i.e., a bottom-up analysis), and (2) explain how\\r\\nthose operations fit into the larger domain of SOCs and their\\r\\ntrajectory (i.e., a top-down analysis). Moreover, to confirm\\r\\nthat our observations in the context of COVID-19 are not\\r\\nspecific to only one SOC, we quantitatively interviewed seven\\r\\nother SOCs. Figure 1 illustrates the high-level procedures and\\r\\nmethods taken to conduct this study.\\r\\n3.1  Historical Analysis\\r\\nOur historical analysis aims to understand, within larger-scale\\r\\nchange, the trajectory of endpoint control in present-day SOCs\\r\\nduring the WFH phenomenon triggered by COVID-19. To\\r\\nthe best of our knowledge, we are the first paper to perform a\\r\\nhistorical analysis of endpoint security control through SOCs.\\r\\nOur historical approach, a qualitative research method, can\\r\\nbe understood asapplied[55], in that it is designed tounder-\\r\\nstand specific phenomena.

1:Synthesis of Ethnography and Historical Analysis– Historical analysis is used to identify long-term trends and methods\\r\\nto capture those trends in the current day. Our ethnography provides the high-level issues but also acts as a validating resource\\r\\ntowards the trends identified through historical analysis. To confirm and generalize our findings, qualitative interviews with the\\r\\nSOC employees were conducted whilst pairing a quantitative interview (survey) with seven other SOCs.\\r\\nHistory Museum [30]), which provide certainty as to a piece\\r\\nof evidence’s providence. As shown in Algorithm 1, we begin\\r\\nthe historical analysis with these listed sources.\\r\\nKeywords and Filtering: This line of historical inquiry in-\\r\\ncludes better-known phenomena and events, such as, the emer-\\r\\ngence of the Security Operations Center. We focus on histori-\\r\\ncal trends in the monitoring and management of networked,\\r\\nlocal host machines, or endpoints by first searching for the\\r\\nphrase \\\"endpoint management\\\" and working backwards in\\r\\ntime from the first account of \\\"endpoint management\\\" to the\\r\\nfirst known instance of securing endpoints. Next, we explain\\r\\nthese trends by revealing their origins in (1) broad functional\\r\\nrequirements that arise from a combination of the network and\\r\\nhost architectures, and (2) the scale, kinds, and geographic\\r\\ndistribution of use. In other words, we look for fundamental\\r\\nchanges to endpoints that would negatively impact endpoint\\r\\nsecurity management during that era. After analyzing the re-\\r\\nsulting documents, we continue to extract common phrases\\r\\nused under the context contained within multiple selected\\r\\ntexts (e.g., \\\"NOC\\\", \\\"SOC\\\", \\\"content handling\\\", \\\"acceptable\\r\\nuse policies\\\"). As our terminology expanded, our inquiry led\\r\\nus to phenomena that, while uncontroversial, fall outside of\\r\\nthe usual scope of Internet history. Such phenomena include\\r\\nthe basic security practices of 1970s and 1980s campus and\\r\\noffice computer labs, such as \\\"keycard locks\\\" and \\\"antivirus\\r\\nsoftware\\\". We select accounts which were professionally ref-\\r\\nereed, and which appear (retrospectively against the historical\\r\\nrecord) to reflect standard or increasingly standard practices.\\r\\nThe list of keywords and the corresponding resources is avail-\\r\\nable in Appendix A.1 – Table 5.\\r\\nAs we broaden our scope more towards present-day whilst\\r\\nadding peripheral context, the amount of relevant work dras-\\r\\ntically accumulates.  For these cases, we also pair Google\\r\\nNGRAM [49] with Google Scholar samplings to understand\\r\\nlong withstanding terminology frequencies paired and how\\r\\nthey were used in publications during those periods. Through\\r\\nthis, we are able to observe major changes in the technolo-\\r\\ngies, techniques, and terminology specific to endpoint security\\r\\nmanagement. This technique enables us to uncover historical\\r\\nactivities that would not appear when, for example, searching\\r\\nfor \\\"cybersecurity\\\" in 1980s publications.\\r\\nGenerating Periodizations: Occurring after we finish filter-\\r\\ning texts, collecting key words, and utilizing Google NGRAM,\\r\\nour historical analysis enables us to identify and describe six\\r\\nmain periods of endpoint management. We do not suggest\\r\\nthat the basic characteristics of these periods were uniform,\\r\\nbut instead, that these characteristics describe general trends\\r\\nthroughout history. Our date ranges are approximate, and de-\\r\\nnote a “season” of endpoint management. We limit our focus\\r\\nto unclassified Arpanet/Internet-connected endpoints on enter-\\r\\nprise networks: this excludes non-Arpanet/Internet endpoints\\r\\nand private access through Internet Service Providers (for\\r\\nreasons explained below). Our history presents a subset of the\\r\\nInternet’s far larger historical evolution. Our goal is to explain\\r\\nthe adaptation of the historical lineage with causal links to\\r\\npresent-day endpoint technologies, rather than a complete\\r\\nglobal history of networking and paths not taken. We note\\r\\nhere that the identified trends are not always as visible from\\r\\nindividual experience, and thus, there are many current-day\\r\\nsolutions that we do not mention as their origin fall inside our\\r\\ndefined periods but outside of the evolution of SOC endpoint\\r\\nsecurity management.We date technologies to the period of\\r\\ntheir widespread use, and not to their invention.\\r\\n3.2  Ethnography and Fieldwork\\r\\nA major limitation of finding patterns in history is correlation\\r\\nin time, but only in time. In short, we have no empirical ac-\\r\\ncount of the actual dynamics: the changes in SOC techniques\\r\\nand technologies that one would expect to see in response\\r\\nto one of the theorized external forces. To help solidify our\\r\\ninitial SOC observations (indicators of endpoint management)\\r\\nand findings from our historical analysis, we leveraged three\\r\\nethnographic research methods: (1) participant observation\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"6QKJJjZU7TWBH0bvYZPABab5ezKwsO17Ha1QqvYLToU=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_5\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nfield notes combined with Grounded Theory Method, (2) semi-\\r\\nstructured interviews, and (3) surveys.\\r\\nParticipant Observation: Field notes were collected through\\r\\nparticipant observation [64, 106, 107] by embedding an ob-\\r\\nserver into a SOC. These insights allow us to better understand\\r\\nthe pressures and challenges faced by a real-world SOC.\\r\\nFor 34 months (June 10, 2019 to May 16, 2022), one field-\\r\\nworker was embedded within our observed SOC to collect\\r\\nfield notes. A graduate student with a background in com-\\r\\nputer science  worked alongside SOC  analysts to  help im-\\r\\nprove operations whilst recording observations and gaining\\r\\nan in-depth understanding about the environment. Embedded\\r\\n7.80±2.06 hours a week for a total of 1,000+ hours, our\\r\\nfieldworker recorded their observations based on over 500\\r\\nemployee discussions. Aside from meetings, the fieldworker\\r\\nalso analyzed the ticketing systems, tools and solution deploy-\\r\\nments, and documentation. Although some of the communica-\\r\\ntion occurred through e-mail and Microsoft Teams [78] prior\\r\\nto WFH, the WFH transition increased this type of digital\\r\\ncommunication and video conference calls.\\r\\nGrounded Theory Method:  We  used  Grounded  Theory\\r\\nMethod (GTM) to analyze the 352 collected field notes (addi-\\r\\ntional details of which can be found in Appendix A.2). GTM\\r\\nallows us to create theories using interviews and/or partici-\\r\\npant observation field notes. This approach has been leveraged\\r\\nin previous works to uncover user perceptions’ around pri-\\r\\nvacy [3] and cryptocurrency [72] as well as modelling analyst\\r\\nburnout [106]. Thus, GTM allows us to uncover and extract\\r\\nmeaningful themes of SOCs in the context of COVID-19.\\r\\nPrior to COVID-19, we focused on analyzing cybersecurity\\r\\nmetrics. Our focus of SOCs, with respect to COVID-19, redi-\\r\\nrects our analysis to attempt to answer the following open-\\r\\nended questions: (1) what happens to a real-world security\\r\\nenvironment during a crisis and (2) how do tools, services,\\r\\nand analysts “react” to the unexpected circumstances?\\r\\nWith our defined research questions, we iteratively ana-\\r\\nlyzed field notes by following GTM’s three steps: open cod-\\r\\ning, axial coding, and selective coding [104]. The first itera-\\r\\ntion, open coding, involves parsing the field notes to identify\\r\\ninsights and uncover potential phenomena by labelling ob-\\r\\nservations known as codes throughout the documents. After\\r\\nidentifying our codes, we performed axial coding which con-\\r\\nsists of combining the previous codes from open coding into\\r\\nlarger themes. Based on these larger themes, we leveraged\\r\\nselective coding to understand the reasoning behind each of\\r\\nthese categories. Specifically, why these themes are the main\\r\\nconcerns. The codebook is included in Appendix (Table 7).\\r\\nSemi-structured Interviews:   To  validate,  or  invalidate,\\r\\nthemes extracted by GTM, we conducted two rounds of live\\r\\n30-minute, semi-structured interviews with eight internal SOC\\r\\nemployees for a total of 12 interviews (as seen in Table 1). Be-\\r\\ntween interview rounds, one employee transitioned to another\\r\\ndepartment and three employees reduced their workload to\\r\\nparticipate in the second round of interviews. Questions were\\r\\nforwarded to each employee a few days prior to the interview,\\r\\nso participants would feel more comfortable. When sending\\r\\nthe questions and upon beginning the interview, participants\\r\\nwere notified that (1) these are semi-structured interviews,\\r\\nthus we may ask other questions about the topic at-hand, and\\r\\n(2) they could opt out or add to questions as desired.\\r\\nWhilst  our fieldworker was  embedded, they  personally\\r\\nnoted an impact on work, productivity, and communication.\\r\\nBased on these observations, questions were tailored to elu-\\r\\ncidate these phenomena. A focus upon analysts’ perceptions\\r\\nof the changed environment was taken for the first round of\\r\\ninterviews. Thus we asked about their respective roles and\\r\\nhow they felt if those roles had or had not altered. During\\r\\nthe second round, we wanted to uncover analysts’ percep-\\r\\ntions surrounding our derived themes and to better understand\\r\\nthe context surrounding moretechnicallybased themes. The\\r\\nfieldworker analyzed the interview notes via coding until the-\\r\\nmatic saturation was reached [57]. More information on the\\r\\ninterview process is located in Appendix A.3.\\r\\nSurveys: We leverage historical analysis to understand long-\\r\\nterm trends in SOCs, but a generalization of the findings from\\r\\nour ethnography is necessary. From July 26 to Aug 5, 2021,\\r\\nwe conducted quantitative interviews with seven SOCs. In\\r\\nthis research, a survey is a type of quantitative interview [60]\\r\\nThese quantitative surveys consisted of close-ended ques-\\r\\ntions allowing us to (1) follow our previous findings and (2)\\r\\nreduce the amount of required effort from the respondents.\\r\\nWhilst crafting this survey, we followed the Brief, Relevant,\\r\\nUnambiguous, Specific and Objective method (BRUSO) [60]\\r\\nto decrease required respondent effort. For close-ended ques-\\r\\ntions, we provided many answers, but we also included an\\r\\nadditional category in the case a respondent did not feel like\\r\\nthe  provided answers  were  sufficient.  We  standardize  the\\r\\nanswers provided in the demographics section by following\\r\\nprevious work [31]. Lastly, to prevent “item-order” effect (i.e.,\\r\\nordering of questions alter responses), we alter the ordering\\r\\nof available selections on multiple choice questions.\\r\\nBecause we cannot determine the population sampling size,\\r\\nwe chose a non-probability sample method: convenience sam-\\r\\npling [60]. Since we choose participants in close proximity\\r\\nwilling to partake in this research, we may introduce a slight\\r\\nsampling bias; however, we pose that we are not attempting\\r\\nto uncover new trends from this survey, rather, we aim to\\r\\nvalidate our findings from the ethnography.

In a hierarchical structure, the SOC includes\\r\\nthree layer 2 (L2) analysts who oversee incident management,\\r\\nalert remediation, and security engineering. The two L3 and\\r\\nL4 managers’ responsibilities focus more on planning future\\r\\ninfrastructure to increase the organization’s security posture;\\r\\nhowever, they also assist with L2 activities as needed.  L1\\r\\nanalysts are located in general IT help desk, and they are\\r\\nnot directly included in our study. L1 analysts have limited\\r\\nformal security training, and their cybersecurity functions\\r\\ninclude well-documented processes: password resets, unlock-\\r\\ning disabled accounts, and assigning encryption certificates.\\r\\nAlthough the SOC manages the majority of security-related\\r\\nevents, it is fairly small (see Table 1) with a low-medium\\r\\nmaturity rate per SOC-CMM [117].\\r\\nSurvey Demographics: Since our findings cover the impacts\\r\\non SOCs rather than individual employees, we reached out\\r\\nto Chief Information Security Officers and similar positions\\r\\nto answer on the behalf of their respective SOC.

Lastly, we stored notes and the survey results\\r\\nwhere only the participating researchers were provided ac-\\r\\ncess. Besides verbally informing the participants about our\\r\\npractices, we also provided them with our IRB-approved pro-\\r\\ntocol document. For the survey, due to the generally sensitive\\r\\ntechnical nature of the discussed topics, we provided written\\r\\ndisclaimers about questions being optional, and committed to\\r\\naggregating and anonymizing results.\\r\\n4  The Evolution of Endpoint Management\\r\\nThe findings from  our historical analysis are summarized\\r\\nbelow (additional information is available in Appendix A.1).\\r\\nDetailed in Section 3.1, our goal is to understand the historical\\r\\ntrajectory of endpoint control based on causal links to present-\\r\\nday SOCs (not a complete global history).\\r\\nThe Early Operational Arpanet (1972-1979): The Arpanet\\r\\nnetwork layer consisted of a network of packet-switching In-\\r\\nterface Message Processors which implemented a distributed\\r\\nrouting algorithm and error correction [76]. Outside of a small\\r\\nnumber of secured networks for classified work [112], net-\\r\\nwork security was largely based around endpoint’s regulated\\r\\nphysical spaces [37, 38]. Overall the DARPA-led ecosystem\\r\\nof researchers and contractors exercised multiple forms of\\r\\nendpoint control. Basically, each site required access control\\r\\nmeasures—physical or software-based—to ensure only autho-\\r\\nrized users and, crucially, authorized use. While there were no\\r\\ntechnical or organizational mechanisms for content handling\\r\\nas defined today, content was nonethelessmanagedby regulat-\\r\\ning use of the systems and the identity of the users [34, 35, 42].\\r\\nThe ARPA Internet (1980-1986): Between 1976-83, Arpanet\\r\\ntransitioned to becoming the official core routing area of the\\r\\nnew Internet [96].

The DCA\\r\\nfurther developed its requirements for organizational manage-\\r\\nment of endpoints and added centralized access control to the\\r\\ndial-in points [44]. Meanwhile, PCs began replacing terminal\\r\\nrooms and computer service centers [24].\\r\\nAll of these changes differentiated the network edge be-\\r\\nyond a smaller number of highly managed and physically con-\\r\\ntrolled machines. To account for the fragmentation, DARPA\\r\\ndirected the implementation of the Domain Name System\\r\\nresulting in a new set of regulations and organizational re-\\r\\nquirements [105]: local security policies to prohibit misuse\\r\\nand to ensure proper technical configuration [89, 90]. The\\r\\nlocal computing facilities connected to this network, how-\\r\\never, remained largely the same. Excluding sites with strict\\r\\ninformation security (e.g. government classification), com-\\r\\nputer labs and centers enforced “acceptable use” through both\\r\\norganizational and technical means [2, 82].\\r\\nThe NSFNET Before Privatization (1986-1990): The Na-\\r\\ntional Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) backbone be-\\r\\ngan connecting regional networks, which linked campus net-\\r\\nworks with the ARPA Internet [2]. The trend toward network\\r\\nedge fragmentation, already underway, intensified with (1) the\\r\\nrapid proliferation of attaching networks [15, 98], (2) private\\r\\nvendors offering heterogeneous networking protocols and\\r\\nproducts [83], and (3) the large-scale replacement of main-\\r\\nframes with PCs [24]. Network management quickly became\\r\\n“the most pressing issue in data communications” [26]. The\\r\\nendpoint control requirements for the NSFNET’s networks\\r\\nmimicked those on the Arpanet. Visible in the Acceptable\\r\\nUse Policies (AUPs), it permitted authorized users and use,\\r\\ncontained no expectation of privacy, and network operators\\r\\ncould remove misbehaving entities from the network [2, 82].\\r\\nNew networking tools expanded the central monitoring of\\r\\nhost behavior [2, 82] and helped lab administrators maintain\\r\\nthe same level of control over endpoints as previously exer-\\r\\ncised over the mainframes. Anti-virus and disk management\\r\\nsoftware (e.g., flashing/formatting hard drive and reinstalling\\r\\nsoftware), became a widespread commercial product during\\r\\nthis period, monitored system files and processes, and rou-\\r\\ntinely brought end systems back to their proper configura-\\r\\ntion [33, 99]. Due to this, the beginnings of distrust to hard-\\r\\nware began [99]. Organizations created formal information\\r\\nsecurity policies to control these computers [45].\\r\\nConnected, Private Enterprise Networks (1991-1999): Dur-\\r\\ning the mid-1990s changes in Internet technologies and use\\r\\ndrove new changes in endpoint control. At the highest lev-\\r\\nels, the privatization of the NSFNET (and thus the civilian\\r\\nInternet) backbone began [85]. By 1993, bottom-up Internet\\r\\ngrowth expanded Internetwork connections dramatically out-\\r\\nside of the control typically exercised by the U.S. Government\\r\\nover the 1980s Internet [28, 41]. Border Gateway Protocol\\r\\n(BGP) helped shield global routing from these new, institu-\\r\\ntionally distant networks [17, 28, 71, 92]. The 1993 “Eternal\\r\\nSeptember” cultural phenomenon attests to longtime users’\\r\\nwidespread perception that “netiquette” could no longer be\\r\\nenforced on new users through social mechanisms [68].\\r\\nAfter a wave of automation [25, 94] and the rise of tick-\\r\\neting  systems  in  the  late  1980s  [58, 61, 65], securing  end\\r\\nsystems in organizations was highly institutionalized. Organi-\\r\\nzations introduced physical access control and logging (e.g.\\r\\nCCTV) [14, 62]. LAN servers were in use to increase the\\r\\nresolution of control beyond re-imaging systems on reboot\\r\\nand cleaning out viruses and worms [14], and on the social\\r\\nend, organizations created centrally managed contact-points\\r\\nfor reporting online abuse [12, 13]. AUPs proliferated in order\\r\\nto help regulate endpoint use [50].\\r\\nDiversifying the Enterprise Network Edge (2000-2019):\\r\\nThe 2000s and 2010s brought a new and dramatic wave of\\r\\nnetwork differentiation. Laptops, which came into widespread\\r\\nuse in the 1990s, were increasingly integrated with enterprise\\r\\nnetworks as technologies like IPsec [46, 111] and the Peer-to-\\r\\nPeer Tunnelling Protocol [88, 100] enabled better security for\\r\\nremote use. Although network encryption was introduced in\\r\\n1970s, we see the phrase \\\"endpoint encryption\\\" termed during\\r\\nthis time [37,51]. Smartphones and tablets furthered this trend\\r\\nwhilst also increasing mobility [121]. The Google NGRAM\\r\\nresults for “Work From Home” increase gradually during the\\r\\npost-war US (1945 - 1970s), with significant growth in the\\r\\n1980s, and spike dramatically in 1998-99 [52]. Externally, the\\r\\nInternet spread to include individual, institutional, and nation-\\r\\nstate adversaries, not only with attacks on networks and end\\r\\ndevices, but also on users (i.e., social engineering) [23].\\r\\nThis period is one of integration and further automation\\r\\nof NOC/SOCs, and the second half of this period sees their\\r\\nincreasing ability to monitor and manage end devices. Mid-\\r\\ndleware such as firewalls—and their increasing integration\\r\\ninto other tools—responded to the growing threats outside\\r\\nthe enterprise network [8]. Cloud computing permitted new\\r\\nforms of network architecture, management, and flexibility\\r\\n(e.g. Software Defined Networking), as well as easier han-\\r\\ndling of content intended for end devices (e.g. email, web\\r\\nlinks) [54, 70]. Heavy office desktop machines and labs full of\\r\\nsecured personal computers gave way to ubiquitous laptops\\r\\nand smartphones [121]. This phenomena introduced “bring\\r\\nyou own devices” (BYOD) along with the challenges to se-\\r\\ncure an even more distributed environment [79].\\r\\nCaptured later in our ethnography, on the eve of COVID-\\r\\n19’s global spread, vendors offered—and organizations im-\\r\\nplemented—an increasingly wide range of endpoint control\\r\\nsystems. Although we located evidence of technological dis-\\r\\ntrust during  the  80s, the  Zero  Trust Framework, formerly\\r\\npublished in 2020, furthers this perception of distrust [95].\\r\\nThe Patterns of Endpoint Management to COVID-19:\\r\\nBased on our historical analysis, we draw the following con-\\r\\nclusions for our ethnographic investigation.

Thus, we\\r\\nsuggest thatany present-day expansion of largely technical\\r\\nendpoint control mechanisms reflects one period in a longer\\r\\nseries of changes that predate COVID-19.\\r\\nEndpoint management is carried out through a mix of or-\\r\\nganizational and technological means. These organizational\\r\\nmeans are simply the structured (or programmed) human ac-\\r\\ntivity necessary to operate complex technical systems (e.g.,\\r\\nin-person lab monitoring and ticketing systems). In the histori-\\r\\ncal scholarship, these organizational means are less prominent,\\r\\nbecause we suggest that they are not classified as important in-\\r\\nnovations or technological accomplishments – many of these\\r\\norganizational mechanisms predate even the Arpanet [91].\\r\\nWe interpret this history to suggest that the organizationally\\r\\ninstituted endpoint management techniquesworked, in part\\r\\nbecause they managed simpler systems with fewer threats.\\r\\nWhen organizational techniques became too labor-intensive\\r\\nor lost effectiveness due to the changing contexts, administra-\\r\\ntors turned to technological solutions, and thus to a drive to\\r\\nautomate. Through Internet history, endpoint management un-\\r\\nderwent a process of automation, whereby manual tasks were\\r\\npartially replaced with combinations of digital computation\\r\\nand (likely fewer, and perhaps different) manual tasks.\\r\\nAs the endpoints moved beyond the domain of local orga-\\r\\nnizational control–either in new distributed forms through-\\r\\nout an organization, or completely outside the organization\\r\\nitself–the effectiveness of organizational management tech-\\r\\nniques for endpoint systemsmust havedeclined dramatically.\\r\\nThis decline, in turn, triggered technological solutions, or re-\\r\\nplacements, for these formerly manual tasks (i.e., automation).\\r\\nGiven resource constraints in the contexts under study, we\\r\\nassume that investments from the enterprise network’s man-\\r\\nagement, who oversees operation and security, were made\\r\\nout of necessity. We argue that the widespread nature of the\\r\\nchanges documented here further rules out highly localized,\\r\\ncultural, or irrational causes in general–and instead points\\r\\nto shared organizational and technological solutions to chal-\\r\\nlenges posed by the changing technical and use environment.\\r\\n5  Ethnographic Analysis of a SOC in the U.S.\\r\\nIn this section, we discuss our discoveries from studying a\\r\\nhierarchical-structured U.S. SOC securing over 30,000 users.\\r\\nA major limitation of finding patterns in history is correlation\\r\\nin time, but only in time. Through ethnographic approaches,\\r\\nour main goal is to provide empirical evidence of a SOC\\r\\nchanging in light of COVID-19’s WFH, namely by how an-\\r\\nalysts redirect their efforts during this change (e.g., labor-\\r\\nautomation via tools, manually intensive tasks).\\r\\nAs indicated by our historical analysis, if we locate organi-\\r\\nzational means and forms of automation specific to endpoint\\r\\nsecurity management, COVID-19 may potentially indicate an-\\r\\nother period of increased endpoint security management. Sim-\\r\\nilar to the phenomena of BYOD, this period may introduce\\r\\nadditional challenges for SOCs [79]. In short, specific themes\\r\\nof the ethnographic study determined by the historical review\\r\\ninclude our ethnographic emphasis on the SOC ‘tooling up’\\r\\nwith automation techniques in order to deal with endpoint\\r\\nchallenges (as detailed below), and that history showed us\\r\\nthat there was always a social and a technical dimension.\\r\\n5.1  Participant Observation Findings\\r\\nBefore and throughout the COVID-19 transition, our embed-\\r\\nded fieldworker operated alongside analysts to develop in-\\r\\ndepth knowledge about the environment. Known as partici-\\r\\npant observation, the following subsection outlines our find-\\r\\nings strictly from this methodology.\\r\\nOur fieldworker observed and noted the SOC’s dependence\\r\\non  the  firewall, vulnerability  scanner  agents, and  locally-\\r\\ninstalled anti-virus on endpoints to protect the majority of\\r\\nusers. Our embedded fieldworker experienced, first-hand, the\\r\\nshifting priorities within the SOC as a response to COVID-\\r\\n19’s WFH phenomena. Based on these evolving priorities,\\r\\nshown in Figure 2, we identified one trend that, we believe,\\r\\nwill alter the long-term methods SOC employees use to secure\\r\\ntheir environment - endpoint management. Furthermore, we\\r\\nalso experienced the unintended consequences of this trend\\r\\nsuch as privacy implications and analyst burnout.\\r\\nPreparation - The Beginning (Early-Mid March 2020):\\r\\nDuring the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we wit-\\r\\nnessed the majority of users and their work devices moving\\r\\noff the physical campus rendering  a  number of processes\\r\\nineffective such as devices not present behind the firewall,\\r\\nexternal traffic not detected by the intrusion detection system\\r\\n(IDS), and the VPN at maximum capacity.\\r\\nIn  this  SOC, the  analysts  maintain  the  VPN, thus  they\\r\\nscrambled to increase the VPN capacity and ensure not only\\r\\ncould end users securely connect to and access on-premise\\r\\nresources, but the SOC also needed to protect endpoints from\\r\\nexternal threats when accessing the World Wide Web.\\r\\nAside from increasing the VPN capacity, communication\\r\\nchanged,“[Virtual] communication went through the roof ”\\r\\n(P1). Talking to other employees is no longer a casual con-\\r\\nversation which P5 expressed,“Hallway conversations don’t\\r\\nexist anymore, so we have to be more direct.”In other words,\\r\\nthese 5-minutes cubicle conversations turned into 60-minutes\\r\\nvirtual meetings.

Upon the organization temporarily pausing operations and the follow of users returning, the SOC worked towards not only\\r\\nidentifying changes needed to support the new environment but also considering the change in current security controls.\\r\\nSOC was forced to temporarily oversee these security-related\\r\\noperations in addition to the SOC’s current tasks.\\r\\nTo summarize, the SOC balanced increasing the cybersecu-\\r\\nrity tools’ capacity and overseeing additional security tasks\\r\\nwhilst the organization demanded more of their time.\\r\\nMonitoring (Mid-Late March 2020): To ensure the organi-\\r\\nzation can still operate, both users and employees who did\\r\\nnot have an organization-owned device were offered one, thus\\r\\nthe number of deployed endpoints increased. However, the\\r\\nanalysts quickly highlighted the dangers of this such as doc-\\r\\numenting the device inventory going home with end users.\\r\\nNotably, P5 expressed their concerns regarding device inven-\\r\\ntory,“I’m concerned about endpoint monitoring and endpoint\\r\\npatching. I want to know what was taken off-campus and if\\r\\neveryone told the correct personnel to keep track of inventory.”\\r\\nThis concern’s motivation comes from (1) how the physical\\r\\nnetwork location is an important indicator for threat detection,\\r\\nand (2) if new security-related technology needs to be in-\\r\\nstalled on these endpoints, the SOC needs to determine which\\r\\nendpoints currently do or do not have that protection.\\r\\n“It doesn’t do any good to provide security on campus\\r\\nwhen there isn’t anyone there anymore.”(P2) Aside from the\\r\\nincreased endpoints, yet a lack of device inventory, the ana-\\r\\nlysts were also concerned with the decreased transparency of\\r\\ntheir endpoints’ actions. Within our SOC, there was a heavy\\r\\nreliance upon the firewall and network access points for net-\\r\\nwork transparency. However, all of these devices shifted from\\r\\nleveraging the campus’ physical access points protected by\\r\\nfirewalls to leveraging home or public networks.  In other\\r\\nwords, the origin of network traffic moved from mainly in-\\r\\nbound to outbound, meaning they were no longer covered by\\r\\nthe organization’s firewall. Although a virtual private network\\r\\n(VPN) will route traffic behind the firewall, not all users in-\\r\\nstalled, or use the SOC-controlled VPN. As P4 pointed out,\\r\\n“we just don’t have visibility on what endpoints are doing”\\r\\nwhich P2, P3, and P5 all agreed.\\r\\nWith an increase in external endpoints (i.e., devices not\\r\\nleveraging the organization’s network) but a decrease in se-\\r\\ncurity coverage (i.e., firewall doesn’t apply to non-VPN traf-\\r\\nfic), the  responsibility of the  SOC  to  protect devices  was\\r\\nstrained. This was particularly evident when another simi-\\r\\nlarly structured organization was targeted by ransomware.\\r\\nAs P5 fearfully expressed,“the news out of [organization’s]\\r\\nransomware attack is dire.”and P2 shared this concerned sen-\\r\\ntiment. This ransomware exploits unpatched vulnerabilities,\\r\\ntargets user accounts and performs spear-phishing attacks.\\r\\nSecuring these vectors requires endpoint patching and mon-\\r\\nitoring incoming emails [110]. This attack was particularly\\r\\nmotivating for the SOC not only because of the attack’s suc-\\r\\ncess as P5 shows,“... 1) It seems likely it’s Netwalker, which\\r\\nis the same ransomware that hit [an organization]. 2) They\\r\\nactually paid”, but in addition, it highlights the lack of end-\\r\\npoint management in which the SOC is no exception:“We\\r\\nalso need to assume that personal devices are a serious threat\\r\\nhere since we cannot enforce any kind of controls over them\\r\\nwith our current toolset. I believe [vendor] has tools we can\\r\\npush out via the VPN client which would help but is not a\\r\\nperfect solution since not everyone is using the VPN.”(P5).\\r\\nIn other words, personal devices located on the end user’s\\r\\npersonal network pose a large problem to work computers.\\r\\nOn top of the issues directly facing the SOC, the organi-\\r\\nzation imposed changes upon all the departments that con-\\r\\ntradicted with the SOC’s needs. During WFH, a few projects\\r\\ncould impact end users such as moving email inboxes into\\r\\nthe cloud, automatically installing client-side software for\\r\\nincreased security, or deploying self-phishing exercises. At-\\r\\ntempting to continue these efforts posed a risk of disrupting\\r\\nthe organization’s end users, thus these projects were tem-\\r\\nporarily suspended.  This means that all of IT temporarily\\r\\npaused projects to allow users to adjust to WFH which con-\\r\\nflicted with the SOC’s attempt to re-establish better security\\r\\ntools in hopes to increase transparency.\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"2LUhhg7w3+EkEZ0E8AhFJZRzN3IuIucnACN/MuWkmrg=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_10":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_10\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":10,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nSuspicious Emails Reported by Users     Counts     Percentage\\r\\nLegitimate Emails                                    1,964        8.6%\\r\\nMalicious - Non COVID-19                     19,819      87.5%\\r\\nMalicious - COVID-19                            880           3.9%\\r\\nTotal                                                         22,647      100%\\r\\nTable 3:  Statistics of COVID-19’s impact on incoming, un-\\r\\nblocked emails from January 1, 2020 to February 1, 2022.\\r\\nAll in all, during March, the SOC increased the VPN ca-\\r\\npacity, attended more meetings, oversaw security functions\\r\\nfrom tier 1 (a.k.a., L1), handled the uncertainty around asset\\r\\ninventory, witnessed the gap of protection across endpoints,\\r\\nand scrambled to identify how to defend against ransomware.\\r\\nShort-Term Response (April-July 2020):  Another prior-\\r\\nity, labor-wise, was an increased effort on monitoring and\\r\\nmanaging malicious emails. In particular, the organization\\r\\nexperienced an influx of malicious emails taking advantage of\\r\\nthe pandemic which coincides with SIEMplify’s survey [101].\\r\\nBecause these emails contained terminology/text specific to\\r\\nCOVID-19, the SOC released public communication reports\\r\\nwhich (P5) helped develop,“are there any other COVID-19\\r\\nemails you could forward to me? I’m working up a memo”.\\r\\nThese experiences paired with public articles highlighting\\r\\nrecent COVID-19 scams (i.e., one manager requested a corre-\\r\\nlation between a public dataset and the organization’s email\\r\\ndataset), increased the priority of monitoring incoming emails\\r\\nand resulted in a new script to calculate the distribution of\\r\\nemails specific to COVID-19. Attackers also filed fraudulent\\r\\nunemployment claims that affected organization’s employ-\\r\\nees who would forward those emails to the SOC. These two\\r\\nevents increased the SOC’s pressure on monitoring emails.\\r\\nThe SOC employs two main techniques when stopping\\r\\nthese types of attacks (blocking malicious URLs and pulling\\r\\nemails from inboxes).  Thus, we wanted to better quantify\\r\\nthe impact on  COVID-19 related emails.  We numerically\\r\\nanalyzed malicious COVID-19 emailsreporteddirectly to\\r\\nthe SOC between January 1, 2020 to February 1, 2022 as\\r\\nseen in Table 3. Out of the 22,647 reported emails during\\r\\nthis duration, 19,819 emails were malicious with 880 of those\\r\\nmalicious emails mentioning COVID-19 within the content.\\r\\nProtecting users from email is not the SOC’s only moti-\\r\\nvation. The SOC also wanted to proactively protect the end-\\r\\npoints’ applications. Additional controls are required to in-\\r\\ncrease endpoint protection, but the SOC’s pre-WFH security\\r\\nsolutions were no longer sufficient.  To address this short-\\r\\ncoming, the SOC focused on re-tuning applications such as\\r\\nZoom [123]. The SOC required adjustments to Zoom across\\r\\nall users such as pushing out updates and mandating security\\r\\nsettings for all users,“FYI the Zoom changes went through\\r\\nlast night.  Password required on all Zoom meetings after\\r\\nthe change (this can’t be shut off) and caller ID masking\\r\\nis enabled for dial in users”(P5). For a clearer understand-\\r\\ning, we calculated the number of times an article covering\\r\\nZoom vulnerabilities was shared amongst the team. Between\\r\\nMarch 15th and December 31st of 2020, the SOC shared 220\\r\\nURLs  containing  various  security information  with 14  of\\r\\nthese URLs discussing the latest Zoom vulnerabilities.\\r\\nAside from reconfiguring applications, the SOC focused on\\r\\ntheir current cybersecurity toolset and adjusted technical set-\\r\\ntings particularly within the anti-virus application: increasing\\r\\npassword complexity requirements (i.e., credential protec-\\r\\ntion), preventing certain applications from executing through\\r\\nthe preexisting anti-virus, and privilege escalation prevention.\\r\\nNot only are these controls similar to endpoint protection, but\\r\\nthey also protect against data loss stemming from the user,\\r\\nwhich in turn protects the organization from compromised\\r\\nuser accounts [77, 102, 115, 119]. To further prevent data loss,\\r\\nthe SOC restricted certain types of device applications as\\r\\ndeemed suspicious by the software (e.g., patch level, device\\r\\nbehavior etc).  These findings are similar to Cybersecurity\\r\\nInsider’s survey where respondents were concerned about\\r\\nunmanaged endpoints leaking data [21].\\r\\nPartially unrelated to COVID-19 but still occurring dur-\\r\\ning the phenomena, establishing these short-term solutions\\r\\nwere met with additional challenges: slow vendors. When\\r\\nattempting  to  establish other services  to  re-instantiate  the\\r\\nsecurity posture, vendors were slow upon providing finan-\\r\\ncial quotes, and the SOC encountered issues implementing\\r\\nproof-of-concepts within the organization.  Furthermore, a\\r\\nlast-minute change caused the SOC to implement an entirely\\r\\nnew encryption certificate setup during the midst of WFH.\\r\\nLong-Term Response (July 2020-January 2021): Whilst\\r\\naccounting for the organization’s pause on projects, the SOC\\r\\nadjusted security settings to better reflect the new phenomena.\\r\\nHowever, these adjustments reflect a short-term solution and\\r\\ndo not account for the lack of transparency or control over\\r\\nendpoints. During this study, the SOC also tested other tools\\r\\nwith more robust monitoring behavior and easier integration\\r\\nwith current tools (i.e., blocking DNS requests through an\\r\\nadditional service  rather than  the  firewall).  This  behavior\\r\\ncoincides with a small percentage of analysts surveyed by\\r\\nCSO [16]. They also consider cloud-based instances instead of\\r\\non-premise installed applications due to the change in location\\r\\nand the concerns related to remotely installing client-side\\r\\napplications (i.e., agentless installation). Unfortunately, to add\\r\\nto the responsibilities of an arguably already overloaded SOC,\\r\\nnewer alert detection services introduce additional challenges\\r\\nsuch as the increase of alerts as P4 and P5 highlight,“how do\\r\\nwe deal with the backlog of alerts?”\\r\\nThe SOC wanted to further secure the organization’s re-\\r\\nsources from compromised endpoints. With devices and users\\r\\nneeding external access into the organization’s data center,\\r\\nthe need for data protection rose which P5 desired,“If there\\r\\nare ways to monitor for massive data [exfiltration] at the bor-\\r\\nder, I’m all ears,”and P4 mirrored,“Daily checks of botnet\\r\\nactivity... Periodic check of SaaS platforms... In regards to\\r\\npotential data exfiltration.”Thus, we witnessed a special case\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"Qu054Kunb8/ppQVcDJVZTHTJr0n4NdIUBUIxNyGMxSc=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_11":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_11\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":11,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nof endpoint management: content handling. We define SOC\\r\\ncontent handling as actions taken to prevent users from ac-\\r\\ncessing the organizations’ resources based upon the content’s\\r\\nsemantic meaning. In this case, the SOC is looking at the\\r\\nsemantic-meaning of data passed through the network.\\r\\nConditional access is another technique used to protect\\r\\nthe organization by restricting endpoints. In this work, we\\r\\ndefine conditional access as the action to restrict endpoint’s\\r\\naccess to specified resources typically based upon semantic\\r\\ninformation. The SOC attended training webinars and tested\\r\\nin-place applications that could potentially limit user’s ac-\\r\\ncess to software applications and data. In order to implement\\r\\nconditional access, analysts determine high-risk features and\\r\\nprevent certain devices with those identified features from\\r\\nobtaining important resources. For example, one discussion\\r\\nrevolved around preventing devices running end-of-life Win-\\r\\ndows 7 from accessing cloud-based storage.\\r\\nEven though these changes are motivated with good inten-\\r\\ntions (e.g., protect the organization from threat actors), we\\r\\nnoted a decrease in end-user’s right to privacy. User devices\\r\\nare not restricted to organizational use and in fact, can be\\r\\nused for personal matters.  With these new tools, the SOC\\r\\nanalysts could now leverage more of the individual user’s\\r\\nactivity as these tools correlate directly to the user rather than\\r\\naggregated network traffic during pre-WFH.  For example,\\r\\nour SOC primarily monitored endpoints’ traffic within the\\r\\nnetwork perimeter. Under the regular operating procedure,\\r\\ndevices were isolated or blocked from the enterprise network\\r\\nwhen suspicious network traffic to and/or from those devices\\r\\nwas detected. Once a device was blocked, its user/users and\\r\\nthe corresponding network administrator were identified and\\r\\nthen notified.Only then, depending on the type of compro-\\r\\nmise and the involved user account(s), the SOC accessed the\\r\\ndevice and analyzed information directly on that endpoint.\\r\\nWith no or very limited network traffic to serve as a warrant\\r\\nfor identifying malicious behavior during WFH, the SOC had\\r\\nto compensate for the lack of visibility by relying on a contin-\\r\\nuous access to endpoint devices that monitor very detailed and\\r\\nin-depth system behavior, system contents, and user activity\\r\\n(similar to a constant search without a warrant/preliminary\\r\\nindicator).  The SOC analysts noted this challenge,“User\\r\\nbehavior [analytics] is a political issue ... the current lan-\\r\\nguage is ’we only monitor devices’ yet it’s typically a 1-to-1\\r\\nratio”(P2), and communicated that they want to address ex-\\r\\npectations to user privacy. We are not aware of endpoint data\\r\\nbeing misused in our SOC; however, this presents the pos-\\r\\nsibility of COVID-19’s WFH phenomena acting as another\\r\\ncatalyst towards decreasing end user anonymity.\\r\\nRe-Establishment (March 2021-May 2022): During these\\r\\nchallenges, we noticed actions towards returning to the office.\\r\\nIn March 2021, a few managers began partially working from\\r\\ntheir on-campus offices (witnessed by our embedded observer\\r\\nduring conference calls). When the mask mandate was lifted,\\r\\nthe SOC’s organization announced new WFH policies, and\\r\\nthe managers requested help to develop a work schedule that\\r\\nsupports at least one analyst physically present at the office\\r\\nand the rest working from home. As the SOC slowly transi-\\r\\ntions back into the office, there are noticeable changes still\\r\\npresent in the wake of COVID-19. In particular, new anti-virus\\r\\nand DNS monitoring systems were integrated into everyday\\r\\nalert handling tasks. Although these two solutions intend to\\r\\nincrease transparency by monitoring the local device no mat-\\r\\nter its location, we are beginning to see the consequences of\\r\\nquickly rolling out tools under stress (tools do not deliver fea-\\r\\ntures suited for day-to-day operations, failed tool integrations\\r\\nwere not removed from devices thus increasing the attack\\r\\nsurface through unmaintained endpoint agents). Furthermore,\\r\\nnew policies regarding data handling, data confidentiality, and\\r\\ndata usage ethics have been issued at an organization-wide\\r\\nlevel. We also see that the majority of meetings are still con-\\r\\nducted online over Zoom or Microsoft Teams. In addition,\\r\\nmany of the projects initially paused have resumed, but many\\r\\ndeadlines have been delayed as a consequence.\\r\\nLastly, we saw a reduced budget greatly affect not only\\r\\nthe organization, but also the employees within this SOC.\\r\\nThese budget cuts, initially occurring at the height of WFH,\\r\\nresulted in a reduced salary across all SOC employees, restric-\\r\\ntions upon onboarding new security tools to protect against\\r\\ncurrent cybersecurity trends, and a drop in training opportuni-\\r\\nties (where the latter was very prevalent in this environment\\r\\npre-WFH). To the best of our knowledge, these continue to\\r\\nthis day. Compounding these arguably stressful events, the\\r\\nSOC also experienced (1) incidents over vacation days thus\\r\\neliminating the potential for relaxation, (2) the nationwide\\r\\nvulnerability, Log4J [6], quickly following the reductions of\\r\\nvacations, and (3) potential cyber threats from the Russia and\\r\\nUkraine war [39]. With an overwhelming amount of stressors\\r\\nplaced on the SOC employees, we witnessed burnout amongst\\r\\nemployees and high turnover in a short time period.\\r\\n5.2  Semi-Structured Interview Summaries\\r\\nTo help validate our findings from participant observation, we\\r\\nconducted two rounds of semi-structured interviews amongst\\r\\nour SOC employees from participant observation.\\r\\nWhilst  our fieldworker was  embedded, they  personally\\r\\nnoted an initial impact on work, communication, and pro-\\r\\nductivity. As the SOC’s initial WFH demands decreased, we\\r\\nconducted the first round during the long-term response period\\r\\n(Oct 2021), and focused on verifying these initial impacts.\\r\\nAlthough we interviewed 12 participants, only 5 partici-\\r\\npants were present for the first round as described in Sec-\\r\\ntion 3. For the first interview, not all participants agreed on\\r\\neach question. This was most times a consequence of em-\\r\\nployment position or duration within the SOC. However, all\\r\\nparticipants felt that their work altered in some way: increase\\r\\n(n=2), decrease (n=1), work changed (n=2).

A similar theme appeared when we\\r\\nasked other participants about communication,“... I won’t get\\r\\na good response unless I put an undue amount of effort into\\r\\n[messaging] them ...that’s gotten worse with COVID because\\r\\nbefore I could speak to them in person and it feels like it\\r\\nwasn’t as hard to get a response”(P2) followed by“I feel out\\r\\nof touch. I wish I could reach out to [our team] as I know they\\r\\nmay feel uncomfortable reaching out to me”(P4). On the other\\r\\nhand, some participants liked the change,“...the quality, effi-\\r\\nciency and accessibility all improved both within and outside\\r\\nthe department”(P5). (P1) echoed this. As for productivity,\\r\\nall participants felt an increase in their productivity except\\r\\nfor (P2),“Our jobs have basically turned into operations, all\\r\\nthe time, which is the worst part of the job for me, and that’s\\r\\nprobably a major part of why [my] productivity is down.”\\r\\nDuring the second round, we wanted to uncover analysts’\\r\\nperceptions surrounding our derived themes (e.g., endpoint\\r\\nsecurity management and end user autonomy). Regarding end-\\r\\npoint management, out of the seven employees (one employee\\r\\ntransferred positions between the interviews and three employ-\\r\\nees were initially unavailable), three participants mentioned\\r\\nthe lack of transparency amongst user devices. To note, three\\r\\nadditional participants did not comment on transparency due\\r\\nto their responsibilities on access management. The remaining\\r\\nparticipant focused on motivation overcoming the company’s\\r\\nculture. In fact, five participants pointed out COVID-19 was a\\r\\nmotivator for deploying better features. Five participants also\\r\\nagreed that the motivation behind content handling was simi-\\r\\nlar to endpoint management. All employees have not deeply\\r\\nconsidered endpoint exposure or administrative accountability\\r\\nalthough they were in agreement these should be done.\\r\\n6  Quantitative Survey Summaries\\r\\nSince participant observation is limited to one SOC, we note\\r\\nthat this can be a major limitation. To help generalize our\\r\\nethnographic  findings, we  conducted  quantitative  surveys\\r\\n(July 26 to August 5, 2021) with seven other SOCs.\\r\\nRelevancy and Representativeness: To ensure anonymity,\\r\\nwe cannot provide the SOCs’ names, but some of our partici-\\r\\npants oversee multi-layered SOCs for Forbes 500 companies,\\r\\nacademic institutions, and government entities. Seven SOCs\\r\\nmay not constitute a sufficient statistical sampling size, but we\\r\\nput forth that the variety of our participants help generalize\\r\\nour ethnographic findings (e.g., differing sectors, activities,\\r\\npolicies, user base, and funding). For ethical purposes, we did\\r\\nnot ask about budgets, salaries or training opportunities.\\r\\nTo ensure our participants’ relevancy towards our study, we\\r\\nasked about access to endpoints and WFH policies. Six SOCs\\r\\nreported they have access to endpoints, and six SOCs had a\\r\\npartial or hybrid WFH structure prior to COVID-19, yet seven\\r\\nSOCs converted to WFH. Although seven SOCs immediately\\r\\ntransitioned operations to entirely remote work, three support\\r\\nWFH fully after the initial WFH adaptation, and four support\\r\\na partial or hybrid setup. Since this survey’s completion date,\\r\\nCOVID-19 WFH slowly approaches its end with new return\\r\\npolicies (n=2), hybrid work (n=6), and returning to the office\\r\\n(n=1). Thus, we determined that of the eight total responses\\r\\nseven participants are relevant as they perform endpoint secu-\\r\\nrity management (e.g., endpoint detection and response, email\\r\\nmonitoring). The eighth respondent did not answer enough\\r\\nquestions for the study, thus we excluded their response.\\r\\nFindings Summary:  Although COVID-19 caused drastic\\r\\nmoves towards WFH, endpoint transparency altered under\\r\\nspecific circumstances where four of six participants reported\\r\\na decrease in  transparency.  It appears that thebiggest de-\\r\\ntermination towards decreased endpoint transparency lies\\r\\nwithin SOCs who have a mostly local, centralized workforce.\\r\\nSOCs did not report decreased transparency if they (1) could\\r\\nbe defined as a Managed Security Service Provider or (2)\\r\\nworked with a highly distributed user base. We found that\\r\\nCOVID-19 affected projects, and of the six affected partici-\\r\\npants, three participants explicitly reported projects pausing\\r\\ndue to reprioritization. Four participants experienced projects\\r\\ndropping, progressing slower, but also progressing faster. To\\r\\nfurther generalize  our findings, we  also  found that (1)  all\\r\\nSOCs who monitor emails (six respondents) experienced ma-\\r\\nlicious emails containing COVID-19 content, (2) six SOCs\\r\\nexperienced other departments needing more assistance than\\r\\nnormal, and (3) five participants encountered an increase in\\r\\nmeetings. We summarized the results in Table 4.\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"Be0vIHaRvySYCpr73HO4XcivXNLKa3HE66vAJKEhzmA=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_13":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_13\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\n7  Discussion and Action Items\\r\\nOur historical analysis highlighted that organizational means\\r\\nand forms of automation potentially indicate a new period\\r\\nof increased endpoint security management. Based on our\\r\\nethnographic methods, we identified our SOC’s trajectory\\r\\nchange from maturing (e.g., training staff, configuring SIEMs,\\r\\nautomating redundant tasks) to solely deploying and config-\\r\\nuring automated endpoint security management tools.\\r\\nThe semi-structured interviews contributed to confirming\\r\\nthat the motivation of this shift was COVID-19’s WFH phe-\\r\\nnomena. Lastly, based on our surveys, other SOCs with a local,\\r\\ncentralized workforce were similarly affected and worked to-\\r\\nwards improved endpoint security. With these findings, we\\r\\nsuggest that this pushreflects an intensified periodof end-\\r\\npoint security management. Furthermore, we note that even\\r\\nthough BYOD previously brought very similar challenges,\\r\\nmany current endpoint security tools are costly, thus we also\\r\\nsuggest this intensified period forced many lagging SOCs to,\\r\\nmore permanently, invest into endpoint security [19].\\r\\nA Regulatory Environment for SOCs: While the organi-\\r\\nzational management of endpoints  is  old, SOCs  and their\\r\\npredecessors have, traditionally, used their technology to man-\\r\\nage network components, not endpoints. This has spared them\\r\\nfrom some of the legal and social issues that arise when se-\\r\\nmantically richcontentis handled (e.g., end user browsing\\r\\nbehavior) [122]. We believe that this turn to endpoint control\\r\\nis extremely significant insofar as SOCs come to be expected\\r\\nor seen as a site of content-aware monitoring. With locally-\\r\\ninstalled applications on computers used for professional and\\r\\npotentially for personal use, not only does transparency in-\\r\\ncrease but also the level of control a SOC can apply to these\\r\\ndevices such as blocking URLs to websites, removing emails\\r\\nfrom inboxes, or opening well-known ports for better access.\\r\\nContent monitoring is more easily drawn into culture wars\\r\\nand could even spark calls for regulation [20]. Based on our\\r\\nstudy, we believe SOCs must cautiously proceed with tech-\\r\\nnical actions and consider the sociotechnical aspect behind\\r\\nimplementing endpoint security management.\\r\\nAnother Stimulus of Burnout:  After the initial shock of\\r\\nCOVID-19, a lot of pressures continued to weigh on the SOC\\r\\nanalysts. We saw organization budget cuts resulting in a re-\\r\\nduced salary across all SOC employees, restrictions upon\\r\\nadopting new (proprietary) security-oriented tools, a drop\\r\\nin training opportunities, and incidents over vacation days.\\r\\nCorroborated with various external events (e.g., [6] vulnera-\\r\\nbility, [39]), these factors weighed heavily in the decision of\\r\\nSOC personnel to leave their jobs.\\r\\nAction Item 1 - Device coverage: Lack of transparency was\\r\\nprominent during COVID-19’s WFH yet transparency is an\\r\\nimportant factor in securing systems [43]. Our case study SOC\\r\\nwas able to reconfigure, re-purpose and integrate existing ser-\\r\\nvices into operations whilst recognizing their remaining ineffi-\\r\\nciencies. However, with such a distributed network boundary,\\r\\nendpoint security management focused tools may still not be\\r\\nenough to protect resources. Rather than control all endpoints\\r\\nfrom a network-focused perspective, a Zero Trust perspective\\r\\nmay be more appropriate. Specifically, SOCs should already\\r\\nassume devices are compromised. This allows SOCs to focus\\r\\nmore upon enforcing controls tailored to critical threats (e.g.,\\r\\nlateral movement, data breaches etc.) rather than protecting all\\r\\nendpoints [95]. Our SOC and its parent organization started\\r\\ndedicating resources to enabling such a shift.\\r\\nAction Item 2 - Tracking time for training: Although a Zero-\\r\\nTrust-oriented effort may be warranted, we note that this ap-\\r\\nproach requires processes, technology, and people to imple-\\r\\nment [95]. As we found through participant observation and\\r\\ninterviews, many pressures during COVID-19 led to burnout,\\r\\nand these needed resources may not be available to SOCs.\\r\\nThus, we also propose that SOCs should track time spend\\r\\non training. Many SOCs may have quickly adopted endpoint\\r\\nsecurity management yet may have failed to provide training\\r\\n- particularly towards user-device monitoring challenges (e.g.,\\r\\ncontinuous browsing history to user attribution). We believe\\r\\nthis will help realign SOCs towards increasing maturity.\\r\\nAction Item 3 - Documentation and data needs: Managing\\r\\ncomplex controls in modern endpoint management systems\\r\\ncan be burdensome [73]. Thus, SOCs should ensure that re-\\r\\nstrictions upon semantic content are strictly security-related\\r\\nrather than motivated by other factors. We believe this can be\\r\\naccomplished by documenting policies surrounding the expec-\\r\\ntations of end user privacy. We also believe that these policies\\r\\ncan  help the  SOC  formulate  their precise  data  needs  and\\r\\nin turn potentially reduce user-device content-aware-related\\r\\nchallenges. Our studied SOC has recognized these challenges\\r\\nas permanent, especially since the new monitoring tools and\\r\\nthe reconfigured tools aimed at increasing visibility on end-\\r\\npoints during COVID’s WFH became part of their everyday\\r\\nalert handling process. Moreover, even if most of the organi-\\r\\nzation returned back to an in-person, in-office mode, there are\\r\\nsome groups that were reorganized into a permanent WFH\\r\\nmode. Thus, policy-adjustments at the organization level, doc-\\r\\numenting these changes, and establishing security data needs\\r\\nfrom end-user devices can be viewed as continuous efforts.\\r\\n8  Conclusion\\r\\nThis paper identifies and analyzes a major SOC trend inten-\\r\\nsified by WFH, namely endpoint security management. By\\r\\ncombining historical and ethnographic analysis and method-\\r\\nologies, we highlight not only another catalyst to SOC end-\\r\\npoint security management (i.e., COVID-19’s WFH), but we\\r\\nalso pose that these abrupt changes push SOCs towards a new\\r\\nenvironment of user privacy that they may not be equipped to\\r\\nreadily address. To begin addressing this new climate, SOCs\\r\\ncould start by assessing specific data needs from their end-\\r\\npoints as well as documenting processes for accountability.\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"VtMV0elxy1xSN8TRgKJlBnrU+MEDq9z6eBV5y7QNEYc=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_14":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_14\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":14,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nAcknowledgements\\r\\nWe are grateful to all of our collaborators in this work and to\\r\\nour anonymous shepherd and reviewers for their thoughtful\\r\\nand constructive comments, which vastly improved this paper.\\r\\nThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation\\r\\n(NSF) under Awards 1915824, 1915822, and 1850406.

This section is focused\\r\\non providing additional details about the initial involved en-\\r\\ntities such as ARPA/DARPA and DCA. Moreover, Table 5\\r\\ncaptures the list of keywords resulting from our historical\\r\\nanalysis methodology.\\r\\nThe Early Operational Arpanet (1972-1979): The US Ad-\\r\\nvanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) became the De-\\r\\nfense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1972,\\r\\nwith a brief 1993-96 return to ARPA [32]. ARPA began its\\r\\nlife as a four-node testbed in 1969, and reached basic func-\\r\\ntionality by late 1972 with working host software for common\\r\\noperating systems, remote login (telnet), file transfer (FTP),\\r\\nelectronic mail (SNDMSG and CPYNET) and the formal role\\r\\nof the Network Control Center (NCC) [2, 76, 87]. However,\\r\\nend systems were often shared mainframe systems [76]. Out-\\r\\nside of limited TCP/IP experiments, LAN endpoints directly\\r\\nconnected to a local Arpanet host, and were not nameable or\\r\\naddressable on the Arpanet itself [4, 66].\\r\\nBolt Beranek Newman  (BBN), the contractor that built\\r\\nthe subnetwork and operated it through its Network Control\\r\\nCenter (NCC; the direct predecessor to the Network Oper-\\r\\nations  Center), knew the  topology through a  combination\\r\\nof manual and technical means that were increasingly auto-\\r\\nmated over time [41]. The NCC could disconnect any host\\r\\nif it caused problems for the network [74, 75]. In 1975 the\\r\\nDefense Communications Agency (DCA, current DISA) in-\\r\\ntroduced formal rules for local management of end systems,\\r\\nwhich were implemented by a “network liaison” at each site\\r\\nfor all Arpanet-connected systems [34, 35, 42], all coordinated\\r\\nthrough another DARPA contractor, the Stanford Research\\r\\nInstitute (SRI) and its Network Information Center (NIC).\\r\\nThe ARPA Internet (1980-1986): The Arpanet served as the\\r\\nmain testbed for the TCP/IP suite from the mid-late 1970s, and\\r\\nbecame the Internet’s backbone from 1983-86 (the Arpanet’s\\r\\nlast nodes were decommissioned in 1990) [96]. The Arpanet\\r\\nera  also  initiated the  Internet’s  globally unique  addresses\\r\\nmapped to network interfaces [97], an open application layer,\\r\\nglobal name mapping to addresses [2, 120], end-to-end cryp-\\r\\ntography [37], Local Area Networks [67], and new routing\\r\\ndemands [40] (it garnered the name “ARPA Internet” [93] in\\r\\nsome official documentation). The Arpanet also served as a\\r\\ntemplate for other networks [120].\\r\\nThe NSFNET Before Privatization (1986-1990): A wave of\\r\\nautomation hit network monitoring with the spread of Sim-\\r\\nple  Network Management Protocol (SNMP)  and Hewlett-\\r\\nPackard’s first Network Node Manager (NNM), HP Open-\\r\\nView, both developed from the late 1980s [25, 94]. Triggered\\r\\nby the explosion in network size, complexity, and use, SNMP-\\r\\nbased NNMs automated basic network monitoring and control\\r\\ntasks. This automation, in turn, permitted further division of\\r\\nlabor between more and less skilled analysts. This process,\\r\\nas well as ticketing systems to help organize hierarchical\\r\\nwork, became especially visible in the late 1980s [58, 61, 65].\\r\\nIt also permitted more automated management of heteroge-\\r\\nneous networks, with new protocols such as Asynchronous\\r\\nTransfer Mode (ATM) and Multiprotocol Label Switching\\r\\n(MPLS) now in widespread use for and between enterprise\\r\\nnetworks [80].\\r\\nA.2  Additional Field Notes Statistics\\r\\nAs detailed in Section 3.2, for 34 months (June 10, 2019 to\\r\\nMay 16, 2022), we embedded one fieldworker to collect field\\r\\nnotes.  These field notes are comprised of recollections of\\r\\nattended meetings, discussions with SOC employees whilst\\r\\nworking on projects, and personal observations of the field-\\r\\nworker. The majority of these personal observations stem from\\r\\nperforming similar work to the SOC employees (e.g., monitor-\\r\\ning network traffic, developing machine learning scripts for\\r\\nincreased protection, integrating security tools). Due to our\\r\\nunique perspective, these field notes contain rich, longitudinal\\r\\ndescriptions of the studied SOC environment and, therefore,\\r\\nare our main source of ethnographic data.\\r\\nDuring this study, we analyzed 352 field notes where 57 of\\r\\nthe field notes are from 2019, 121 field notes are from 2020,\\r\\n131 are from 2021, and 43 are from 2022. These field notes\\r\\ncover over 1,000 hours of the analyst embedded in the SOC\\r\\nand contain observations from more than 550 SOC meetings.\\r\\nA.3  Semi-Structured Interviews\\r\\nOur   interviews   intend   to   validate   or   invalidate   our\\r\\nthemes/findings resulting from the Grounded Theory Method\\r\\n(GTM). When interviewing, we used a list of questions as a\\r\\nguide and did not ask each question in order nor did we cover\\r\\nall of them in each interview depending on the time.\\r\\nTable 8 captures our list of questions. Prior to starting the\\r\\ninterview, we forwarded the questions to each interviewee and\\r\\nclarified that they may either interview live (face-to-face) or\\r\\nwrite their answers. Upon interviewing, we reiterated that each\\r\\nquestion is voluntary. Furthermore, we did not record video\\r\\nor audio rather the interviewer (our fieldworker) took notes\\r\\nand typed participants’ quotes during the interview process.\\r\\nWhen an employee asked for something to be removed or not\\r\\nexplicitly stated, the interviewer removed or stopped writing\\r\\nand continued when instructed to do thus.\\r\\nSince the SOC we studied is short staffed, and with the\\r\\nincreased pressure from multiple facets, the lack of resources\\r\\nprevents this SOC (at times) from covering their daily oper-\\r\\nations, troubleshooting unique cases, learning new tools in\\r\\nlight of WFH, and proactively preventing new attacks. This\\r\\nincludes the ability to participate in interviews and surveys.\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"kzFiSWb1qUDf/3E/PsGDoNTTaP7W8JwFpkt7muqNK2M=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_17":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_17\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":17,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nResearch WorksKeywordsEra\\r\\n[4,34,35,37,38,41,\\r\\n42, 66, 74–76, 112]\\r\\nArpanet, NOC, network control, secure facility, secure access, electromagnetic shield\\r\\n(physical security), access control policies, regulating network access, controlling\\r\\nremote access, authentication, management control\\r\\n1972-1979\\r\\n[2,24,40,44,56,82,\\r\\n89, 90, 93, 96, 105]\\r\\nARPA-Internet, Defense Communications Agency, host naming, scalable, central-\\r\\nized access, policies and procedures\\r\\n1980-1986\\r\\n[2,15,24,26,33,45,\\r\\n82, 83, 98, 99]\\r\\nNSFNET, distributed network, nodes, anti-virus, permissions, host monitoring, re-\\r\\nformat, quarantine, network encipherment, acceptable use policies, distrust, identity\\r\\nmanagement, security policies\\r\\n1986-1990\\r\\n[12–14, 17, 25, 28,\\r\\n41,58,61,62,65,68,\\r\\n71, 80, 85, 92, 94]\\r\\nOpenView management, private sector, scale, growth, network isolation, access\\r\\ncontrols, user behavior, surveillance, inventory management, video security cameras,\\r\\nphysical security box, ID badges, updating software, viruses, automation, anti-virus,\\r\\nresponsible use policies, ethics, privacy concerns, middleware\\r\\n1991-1999\\r\\n[8,23,37,46,54,70,\\r\\n88, 100, 111, 121]\\r\\nSDN, IP security, endpoint encryption, network security, reputation management\\r\\nsystems, phishing, fraud, sandbox\\r\\n2000-2019\\r\\nTable 5: Historical Analysis Works – Keywords resulting from our historical analysis methodology.

Furthermore, we observed that these new operations are motivated by various factors.\\r\\nRoundsSemi-Structured Interview Questions\\r\\nFirstRound\\r\\nSecondRound\\r\\n1.How do you feel about the level of work since COVID-19 started? When WFH started?\\r\\n2.Has your level of responsibility increased, decreased, or stayed the same?\\r\\n3.How is the communication amongst the team? With other departments?\\r\\n4.Have priorities shifted since WFH? How so? If priorities have shifted, did it make sense as to why this occurred?\\r\\n5.How has productivity been since WFH happened? Based on the current environment, what change might help improve your productivity?\\r\\n6.Do the current tools support WFH? Would a certain feature provide more help?\\r\\n7.What would you say is the big weakness of the SOC with WFH? How do you think this should be addressed?\\r\\n1.One of the priorities during the initial transition to WFH was endpoint management (i.e., leveraging [organization’s tool] to apply better \\r\\nsecurity policies). What initially motivated this change? After altering the policies within [organization’s tool], are you content with this \\r\\nimplementation?\\r\\n2.Previously, most of these machines were behind the campus firewall, now a lot of them are on external networks. Have you evaluated the \\r\\nexposure due to the remote management systems? For instance, the new [organization’s tool] system is opening up hosts quite a bit so that \\r\\nIT staff can connect to these hosts.\\r\\n3.With the shifts to remotely manage devices, has accountability been considered? Specifically, who has access to and management privilege \\r\\non these remote machines? A few management accounts with admin privileges are shared by IT staff.\\r\\n4.Another transition I noticed was an increased discussion of data loss prevention techniques and how those can be implemented by the \\r\\ncurrent solutions and services. Was this similarly motivated with endpoint management?\\r\\nTable 8: Semi-Structured interview questions – We conducted two rounds of semi-structured interviews within our SOC.

Introduction\\r\\nIHEP su\\u001bers frequent attacks by adversaries with di\\u001berent agendas. To minimize cybersecurity\\r\\nrisks and improve the security operations of IHEP, we have created the Security Operation Center\\r\\n(SOC) in 2021 in IHEP [1], which is a centralized defense group in IHEP based on \\u001cve data pro-\\r\\ncessing layers: data collection, data preprocessing, data storage, data analysis and data application. However, the current SOC setup is mainly used for ensuring the network security of one site and\\r\\nis insu\\u001ecient to defend against cyber-attacks for several collaborative large scienti\\u001cc facilities and\\r\\nscienti\\u001cc data centers across the wide area network. In this paper, a distributed SOC (DSOC) is proposed which can protect several sites from cyber\\r\\nthreats and achieve coordinated operation among multiple sites across the wide area network. The\\r\\nproposed DSOC has three features:\\r\\n•Multiprobe distributed framework: The proposed DSOC contains a data analysis center in\\r\\nIHEP and a few security probes in the sites. The data analysis center interacts with security\\r\\nprobes in client-server mode and integrates data from several sites to achieve multi-site\\r\\ncollaboration. •Multi-function security probe: The security probe can support network tra\\u001ec and security\\r\\nlogs collection, and perform automatic response at the sites by combining data from the\\r\\ncentral data analysis center and security devices of sites. In addition, threat intelligence can\\r\\nbe quickly shared with several sites by using security probe. •Centralized data analysis: The data analysis center can centralize analysis of all site data and\\r\\ndetect known and unknown attacks in the speci\\u001cc security scenarios by rule-based methods\\r\\nand machine learning algorithms. 2.

For example, the brute force attack detection for login servers counts the number of login\\r\\nfailures, and if the number is larger than the threshold, the login IP address is detected as a malicious\\r\\nIP.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"hE2tAvX1prEPUL+zxqgY5X/qFL9WpWyhoO4v9d+jtWU=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"d99163ab-b385-4fbb-9408-b3728a17e097":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"d99163ab-b385-4fbb-9408-b3728a17e097\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf_5\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"1VXNAZ/BZ6qqlMdhdWRVxJ9HLtceOsp/CPrTM5LZY6M=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"cf0758ac-ab3f-480b-816d-d9b37f3abf98\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"hE2tAvX1prEPUL+zxqgY5X/qFL9WpWyhoO4v9d+jtWU=\"}},\"text\":\"The detection \\u001dow is shown in \\u001cgure 5.䇴༽ޞᆿ㠠ࣞሷ䬷㊱ශૂሷ䬷ᆔ⮛\\r\\n⭞ֵᕧਙԚȽ\\r\\nthresholdThe\\u0003number\\u0003of\\u0003failuresLogin\\u0003IP\\u0003address\\r\\nLogin\\u0003failure\\r\\nSSH\\u0003login\\u0003dataset\\r\\nBlack\\u0003IP\\u0003database\\r\\n\\u0003\\r\\n\\u0003㠠ࣞሷ䬷㊱ශૂሷ䬷ᆔ⮛\\r\\nͲ\\u0003\\r\\n\\u0003\\u0003\\u0003\\u0003\\r\\n\\u0003\\u0003\\u0003\\u0003\\u0003\\u0003\\u0003\\u0003\\u0003\\r\\n\\u0003\\r\\n\\u0003\\u0003\\u0003\\r\\n\\u0003\\u0003\\r\\n\\u0003\\r\\n\\u0003\\u0003\\r\\nȽ\\r\\nFigure 5:The brute force attack detection for login servers\\r\\nThe AI-based data analysis deploys anomaly detection algorithms and deep neural network\\r\\nto detect attacks.

The \\u001crst part\\r\\nis threat intelligence collection which aggregates threat intelligence from two sources. One source\\r\\nis the malicious IP database which stores the detected and blocked IP addresses from all sites. The\\r\\nother source is the security related websites which post the malicious IP dataset periodically such\\r\\nas structured data feeds. The second part of the threat intelligence platform is threat intelligence\\r\\nstorage which builds a graph database [25] to store the collected threat intelligence based on the\\r\\nSTIX standard [26]. The third part is threat intelligence sharing in which security probes pull threat\\r\\nintelligence from the threat intelligence database. The last part is the threat intelligence application\\r\\nwhich uses the malicious IP for the threat detection and automatic blocking. 3.7 Security situation awareness\\r\\nThe security situation awareness can provide the overview of security status of every site by\\r\\nvisualizing several statistics, such as the number of threats, the trends of threats, and the origins\\r\\nof threats. The used technologies include Django framework [27], Vue.js [28] and Echarts [29]. Meanwhile, the access control strategy is set up to ensure the data security so that one site can't\\r\\nview the security status of other sites. 4.

Owning a Security Operation Center (SOC) is becoming \\r\\nincreasingly common for organizations as part of their cybersecurity \\r\\nstrategy to ensure near-real-time detection and adequately respond to \\r\\ncyber-attack engaging the SOC’s humans, technology, and processes. However, SOC investments only sometimes achieve the best possible \\r\\noutcomes and only provide an acceptable protection level in some cases \\r\\ndue to the challenges related to the technologies, processes and especially \\r\\nthe human factor. This paper proposes a new practical maturity framework \\r\\nfor Security Operation Center. This will serve as a roadmap for IT auditors \\r\\nand security experts when they evaluate the maturity of a security \\r\\noperation center in terms of safeguarding the assets of the company, its \\r\\npartners, and its clients. INTRODUCTION\\r\\nSecurity operations centers should be analyzed as a management \\r\\ntool for the continuity and quality of the organizations’ opera-\\r\\ntions. Their inclusion in their organizational structure will allow \\r\\norganizations to achieve their strategic objectives. It should be \\r\\nborne in mind that the dissemination of the use of Information \\r\\nand Communication Technologies (ICT) has changed our daily \\r\\nactivities and how we interact with each other as individuals \\r\\nand with companies, organizations and governmental entities, \\r\\norganizations and governmental entities. This increased use of systems, technologies, and communica-\\r\\ntions leads to an increase in cyber threats that take advantage of \\r\\nvulnerabilities to obtain economic benefit through the theft of \\r\\nmoney, money laundering, and financial benefit through the \\r\\ntheft of money or intellectual benefit through patent infringe-\\r\\nment. patents.

Computer security requires a combination of technical knowledge \\r\\nof all computer platforms and management knowledge to articulate \\r\\ndevices, technologies, advanced detection systems, processes, and \\r\\npeople. In this way, it will be possible to effectively and sustainably \\r\\nprotect the assets of interest to the organization (Maleh, 2018). A SOC is a team of security experts in charge of monitoring, \\r\\ndetecting, analyzing and qualifying security events. This team \\r\\nensures the management of appropriate reactions to proven secur-\\r\\nity incidents. For some organizations, this team administers and \\r\\ncontrols the day-to-day management of security systems and mea-\\r\\nsures; for example, the “hardening” of standard operating systems \\r\\nto reinforce their security, or the management of accreditations \\r\\n(access rights to resources) or even the management of “patch \\r\\nmanagement. ” In direct support of the business and partnership \\r\\nwith IT services, a SOC aims to reduce the duration and the impact \\r\\nof security incidents that take advantage of, disrupt, prevent, \\r\\ndegrade or destroy systems dedicated to standard operations. This is achieved through effective monitoring and tracking of inci-\\r\\ndents from end to end. The SOC is responsible, on the one hand, for \\r\\ndeclaring that there is indeed an incident on the IS, and, on the \\r\\nother hand, it is responsible for conducting the operations that will \\r\\nenable it to declare the incident closed. From an operational point \\r\\nof view, it is the combination of the SOC and CERT/C-SIRT entities \\r\\nthat ensures the resolution of an incident (Maleh, 2021). The overall objective of the paper is to demonstrate that \\r\\na security operations center (SOC) is a management solution to \\r\\nthe problem of cyber defense. To achieve the general objective, it \\r\\nwill be necessary to address the first specific objective, which is to \\r\\nintroduce security operations, including the reasons behind creat-\\r\\ning a SOC and its services. Then we will move on to the second \\r\\nspecific objective, which is to explain the triad of processes, people \\r\\nand technologies, whose synergy and interaction support the man-\\r\\nagement of a SOC. Finally, the third specific objective will be devel-\\r\\noped to outline the strategy for creating a maturity model for SOC.

There are few studies on \\r\\nsecurity operations centers (Chamkar, 2022). The first-generation security operation centers were created in \\r\\nthe early years of the internet. Antivirus software and firewalls \\r\\nwere the initial security elements. Monitoring these elements and \\r\\ntaking appropriate action in the event of potential threats or events \\r\\nwas the responsibility of the security operation center, which was \\r\\noften a single person in those days.

But it must offer guidance \\r\\non how security operation centers must be set up. Security vendors \\r\\nlike IBM (Meenan & Laurens, 2015), HP (Hoffmann, 2014), and \\r\\nErnst & Young have released presentations and whitepapers on best \\r\\npractices for designing and implementing security operation cen-\\r\\nters, and they may be found on their respective websites. Since these media promote their products and services, the \\r\\ninformation included might be considered somewhat subjective. In his study on gauging capability maturity in security operations \\r\\ncenters, Van Os (Van Os, 2016) comes to the same result. There are few studies on security operations centers, and each \\r\\nauthor approaches the topic differently. A security operations \\r\\ncenter’s objectives and functional domain are broadly outlined in \\r\\nMichail’s (2015) research paper. The following paragraph goes \\r\\ninto more depth on the functional domains indicated in the study \\r\\nreport and is also explored by Schinagl, Schoon, & Paans (2015) \\r\\nand Jacobs et al. (2013). The objectives outlined in the study by \\r\\nMichail (2015) are, to a considerable part, identical to those \\r\\ndiscussed in the research paper by Kelley & Moritz (2006), \\r\\nwhich examines the best practices of a security operations cen-\\r\\nter (2015). Hoffman (2014, p. 5) made an intriguing point on the \\r\\nbreadth of the security operations center. A security operations \\r\\ncenter’s initial emphasis was on perimeter security. With time, \\r\\na security operations center’s emphasis switched from protect-\\r\\ning the company to protecting the applications.

The realities of today’s information world impose additional \\r\\nrequirements on the center’s tools. The first is the so-called Big \\r\\nData infrastructure. The volume of information generated by all \\r\\ncompany systems has long since easily exceeded terabytes of \\r\\ndata, representing an ill-structured, fragmented mass. The \\r\\nterm “big data” has even emerged in the information field.

Collecting specific events from a limited set of devices is no \\r\\nlonger sufficient, for example, from firewalls and intrusion pre-\\r\\nvention systems. You need to protect and therefore detect mal-\\r\\nicious or anomalous activity at the perimeter and directly within \\r\\nthe corporate network, on resources that are closely or indirectly \\r\\nassociated with assets.

Deploying a Security Operations Center (SOC) is crucial \\r\\nfor businesses to meet and overcome cyber security threats. The \\r\\noriginal notion of a SOC was founded mostly on the reactive sig-\\r\\nnaling of events. With time, the SOC has expanded its purview to \\r\\nencompass incident response, proactive research, and crime pre-\\r\\nvention. The growth and efficiency of a SOC are driven by its \\r\\nability to get greater visibility into network traffic and operations, \\r\\nrespond quickly to security incidents, and deliver reliable threat \\r\\nintelligence. In light of the changes above and the IT auditor’s position as \\r\\na reliable service provider, it’s important to disseminate best \\r\\npractices for evaluating SOC efficiency. Existing best practice fra-\\r\\nmeworks (i.e., ISO2700, CobiT, or NIST-CSF) do not provide in- \\r\\ndepth examinations of SOC operations, alignment, and maturity; \\r\\nhence, the SOC-MF was developed for this purpose. In light of the changes above and the IT auditor’s position as \\r\\na reliable service provider, it’s important to disseminate best prac-\\r\\ntices for evaluating SOC efficiency. The SOC-MF was developed to \\r\\nfacilitate thorough evaluations of SOC operations, alignment, and \\r\\nmaturity. This was primarily necessitated by the requirement for \\r\\nexisting best practice frameworks (such as ISO2700, CobiT, or the \\r\\nNIST-CSF) to accommodate such evaluations. Framework Overview\\r\\nModeling the maturation of SOC capabilities is difficult. This is \\r\\nbecause SOCs use various technologies and provide vastly differ-\\r\\nent services.

SOC maturity model artifacts include \\r\\nthe model and a self-assessment tool for quantitative evaluation. The SOC capability Maturity model was developed after consider-\\r\\nable research of the available literature. All elements found in the \\r\\nliterature were tested for occurrence in actual SOCs by conducting \\r\\na survey among 16 participant organizations.

The five steps of this framework \\r\\nare “identify,” “protect,” “detect,” “react,” and “recover. ” The \\r\\nSOC maturity model does not include a recovery phase because \\r\\nof the SOC’s minimal involvement in most recoveries. Each \\r\\nassessment question was checked for applicability to the NIST \\r\\nCSF and mapped to the most pertinent element for NIST CSF \\r\\nalignment. In addition to being included in the main download, \\r\\nthis mapping may also be obtained independently from the site. CONCLUSION\\r\\nIf properly used, SOC works very efficiently and significantly \\r\\nincreases the effectiveness of information protection activities. At the same time, it is possible to include business continuity \\r\\nmeasures into the center’s area of responsibility, thus creating \\r\\na single point of control and application to comprehensively pro-\\r\\ntect the organization from business interruptions, reduce their \\r\\nprobability, and enable recovery. However, it is possible to go \\r\\na little further and extend the area of responsibility of such \\r\\na center beyond just information security to cover related areas \\r\\nsuch as technical security, physical security, consolidation of \\r\\nvideo surveillance data, control of equipment management sys-\\r\\ntems (power, ventilation, fire-fighting equipment, and many \\r\\nothers). As a result, an information security incident monitoring \\r\\nand response center grows into an organization’s situational or \\r\\ncrisis management center. Nevertheless, the article’s approach \\r\\nalso applies to such a global center. Figure 5Detailed capability maturity scoring.

To fix the risk, statistical noise \\r\\ncontrol techniques for data anonymization are explored and \\r\\nimplemented in this study.

INTRODUCTION\\r\\nThe UK Statistics and Registration Services Act's \\r\\nresponsibility is to produce official statistics and ensure good \\r\\npractice usage of statistics. In these acts (2007), “personal \\r\\ninformation” is information that identifies directly or \\r\\nindirectly a particular person. Data privacy laws such as \\r\\nGDPR [18] in Europe and PDPA [19] in Thailand are both \\r\\nlaws to protect personal data. Since then, data privacy has \\r\\nbecome a hot topic in many countries. The difference between data security and data privacy is \\r\\n‘Who’ can access data in data security and ‘when and what \\r\\ncan they access data in data privacy. For example, login \\r\\nauthentication term in data security is about ‘Who’ can access \\r\\nbut Authorization in data privacy is about ‘what’ and ‘when’ \\r\\nof data that the user is accessible. Therefore, data privacy is a \\r\\ntask for the SOC team rather than an individual system \\r\\nadministrator.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"EtoNoPb4lkV03wuo3jIguVrHJbQ8l0OzOw8jH0FwC7Q=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"7878ebab-3f4b-4b90-a525-60c40a784a06":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"7878ebab-3f4b-4b90-a525-60c40a784a06\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":1,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf_1\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":1,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"jE6w7Pna2L1hsbNScJOGzEjNSjkMVjMSy/uGor1IYNQ=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"74870fa3-09fa-42ce-af4b-7b6276432e06\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":1,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"EtoNoPb4lkV03wuo3jIguVrHJbQ8l0OzOw8jH0FwC7Q=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"fdfc4eda-cb29-434b-b343-5bba898a0863\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":1,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"mrpEY4A1unvmgAR3lzDv1L5XitNH9JSkJs30Iu7otX8=\"}},\"text\":\"Therefore, data privacy is a \\r\\ntask for the SOC team rather than an individual system \\r\\nadministrator. According to The National Institute of Standards and \\r\\nTechnology Framework (NIST), it is almost inevitable for a \\r\\nfirm to have a data breach. This paper intends to propose a \\r\\nnew framework for mitigating a data breach effect. Thailand \\r\\nPDPA laws argue the data controller to notify the data breach \\r\\nincident within 72 hours after detecting the event. The basic approach to preventing data breaches is to hide \\r\\nPersonal Identifier Information (PII) from being exposed by \\r\\nothers without permission. For example, all PIIs are separately \\r\\nstored on different tables. Unfortunately, the datasets that \\r\\nexclude PII combined with other knowledge can reveal \\r\\nunintentionally the personal data. Because data breach causes \\r\\nserious problem by-laws, this research proposed a new \\r\\nframework to protect personal data and comply with privacy \\r\\nlaws. For example, attackers combine our dataset with other \\r\\ndata sets to reidentify personal data. This attack is called a re-\\r\\nIdentification risk [9] that causes a data breach. Data center becomes a data controller or data processor by \\r\\nGDPR/PDPA laws because it holds a lot of personal data. PDPA is a new data privacy law in Thailand. The riskiest data \\r\\ncontroller is a data breach. The simple way of protecting data \\r\\nis cyber security, but there is no guarantee for data privacy. The incident response model was developed based on the \\r\\nprocedures and policies that were implemented within the \\r\\ninstitution. Once an incident happens, the SOC has to team \\r\\ndetermine the adjustments needed for the controls that will be \\r\\nimplemented in different processes whether for technical or \\r\\nnontechnical aspects.

By \\r\\nThailand law, the data controller has to report the data owner \\r\\nwithin 72 hours.

Rather than using the data swapping technique, \\r\\nthe Cell Key Perturbation Methodology is much faster. The CKP method adds a small amount of noise to some \\r\\ncells in a table, meaning that users cannot be sure whether \\r\\ndifferences between tables  represent  a  real  person,  or  are \\r\\ncaused  by  the perturbation. The  method is  consistent  and \\r\\nrepeatable, so the same cells are always perturbed in the same \\r\\nway [4]. Cell Key Perturbation Methodology is to add statical noise \\r\\nto a dataset that can be reidentified. The key concept is to \\r\\nmake a long time for attackers to reveal their original personal \\r\\ndata. Fig. 2. Frequency count on quasi-identifier \\r\\nFigure 2 shows a re-identification risk on the frequency of \\r\\ngroup 1 by using the group-by command. Attackers can guess \\r\\nwho they are if they are unique. A simple group-by-command \\r\\ncannot reveal all other dimensions; therefore, a Perturbation \\r\\ntable or P-table is invented for multidimensional calculation. A perturbation table applied to a cell is a frequency table that \\r\\ncounts a group of attributes. Such a P-table can be obtained \\r\\nusing the R-package P-table [3]. The record keys are random values for each record. When \\r\\ncalculating a table cell, these record keys will be combined \\r\\ninto a cell key. The noise added is based on a cell’s value and \\r\\na ‘cell key’ calculated for each cell. Cell key values are not \\r\\nunique and the same noise can be added to multiple cells. It is \\r\\nimportant to note that the noise is not added randomly: if the \\r\\nsame query is run multiple times, the query will always be \\r\\nperturbed in the same way. In order to apply the cell key method, a microdata file must \\r\\nbe  supplied  containing  categorical  data. An  unperturbed \\r\\nfrequency table is generated based on the variables defined, \\r\\nthen a ‘cell key’ for each value is calculated by summing the \\r\\nrecord keys - integers randomly assigned to each row - from \\r\\nthe contributing rows in the source microdata. A lookup is \\r\\nthen performed on a perturbation table such as a CSV file \\r\\ncontaining a list of perturbation values specifying how much \\r\\nnoise  should  be  applied  to  a  cell.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"u31KGlmSVDvjlIpzeVVoAz/fq0XbK4h9BS8bb8YvVWc=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"cf077690-e133-4cb6-b691-94cff2140d24":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"cf077690-e133-4cb6-b691-94cff2140d24\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf_2\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"47iUik/qVZCKDoq2HMHJ+XxOM5UEb3ORsNhSqWpiGaY=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"668899f2-4470-4fdc-9e9e-13c7edd35c17\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"u31KGlmSVDvjlIpzeVVoAz/fq0XbK4h9BS8bb8YvVWc=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"e583e46a-23d0-4148-a045-cd57106fc3a0\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"U4kNW3gdpDN3D+3raMfoq9KeuDTAtttsk6j8rqifT+k=\"}},\"text\":\"The  final  output  is  a \\r\\nperturbed frequency table that is no longer disclosive.

[2] demonstrated and reaffirmed that \\r\\neven de-identified data that removed all direct personal data is \\r\\nnot enough to protect against re-identification  risk.

Kato  Mivule  demonstrated  [17]  in  his  paper  that  data \\r\\nperturbation utilizing noise addition is a suitable methodology \\r\\nfor published data sets. III. METHODOLOGY \\r\\nAccording  to  GDPR  laws,  Personal  Identification \\r\\nInformation (PII) has to be stored secretly away from hackers; \\r\\ntherefore, they have to be decomposed from the original data. In this process, the SOCs team has to decompose the original \\r\\ndata into two segments including the PII segment and the non-\\r\\nPII segment. For the non-PII segment, we need to add noise to \\r\\nmitigate  and re-Identification risk. In  this  experiment,  the \\r\\nSOC team applied additive noise to the numerical attributes. The following steps are the data preparation process. Firstly, \\r\\nPII has to be identified and then separated into a new secret \\r\\ntable. Secondly, Cell Key Perturbation Methodology [2] is \\r\\napplied to the non-PII segment to prevent re-Identification \\r\\nrisk. Fig. 3. Privacy data segmentation process \\r\\nA. Statistical Noise control technique \\r\\nThe Cell-key method is one of the Statistical Noise control \\r\\ntechniques to protect data privacy. The random record key to \\r\\nevery data record acts as an index of the cells of a pre-defined \\r\\nperturbation table. In order to return the same answer on the same query, \\r\\nthe Cell-key method intend to assign permanently the record \\r\\nkey to each record. These row keys are used to generate \\r\\nconsistent values for the perturbation. Whenever the same \\r\\nquery, the same perturbation will be applied. Cell-key perturbation[13] is a technique used to protect \\r\\nsensitive data by adding random noise to the original data \\r\\nvalues. Perturbation of zeros is a specific type of cell-key \\r\\nperturbation where random noise is added to the cells of a \\r\\ndataset that contain zero values. The purpose of perturbing \\r\\nzero cells is to protect the privacy of individuals by preventing \\r\\nattackers from inferring any sensitive information from the \\r\\nabsence of data.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"nsOWOBGhWYqL9c7/2B2mlG2P87p6s60o/CnP8ZKW0FY=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2724a5bd-b035-4ee6-89bb-9db94580ee4a":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2724a5bd-b035-4ee6-89bb-9db94580ee4a\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf_3\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"llMcJBQtqA7/DVk1hU5QELHf9+A6XiUkfI5c/h7OJjk=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"3fdc4383-5064-47b4-8d01-208be9fe8bc9\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"nsOWOBGhWYqL9c7/2B2mlG2P87p6s60o/CnP8ZKW0FY=\"}},\"text\":\"By using R-key indexes, the frequency of the group was \\r\\ncounted and summed into an integer number and then divided \\r\\nby modulo arithmetic to produce a cell-level key to determine \\r\\nthe perturbation.

The effect \\r\\nof using the perturbation of zeros is that it adds random noise \\r\\nto  the  cells  of  a  dataset  that  contain  zero  values.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"mjGp3uG0QExjykywLORuNZAGaFPTqQkrvZc7DQtTRnw=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ba23d590-1eee-4c99-bbe3-db1afe5ae448":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ba23d590-1eee-4c99-bbe3-db1afe5ae448\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf_5\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"Kh+jcAwx0SqJNXFSQJUTm4omNfMBhL1YKXOQDKvbT9I=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"1ce825d7-2be3-4d03-ae11-3c0b2b328038\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"mjGp3uG0QExjykywLORuNZAGaFPTqQkrvZc7DQtTRnw=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"493387c4-8970-4699-b5d5-19fca3e317cc\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"7asU32rPmxrHALrpyWaz1shiza3YG5mAgFyiiWDsCdw=\"}},\"text\":\"The \\r\\nperturbation of zeros is however out of scope in this paper. We \\r\\nwill cope with these issues in our future work. Cell-key perturbation is a technique that is widely used in \\r\\nEurope. Comparing performance with an existing algorithm is \\r\\ndifficult because Cell-key perturbation is an alternative way to \\r\\nhandle the differencing attacks. Therefore, we hope to make a \\r\\nperformance comparison in future work. VII. CONCLUSION \\r\\nCell-key  perturbation data  privacy  procedure  for  the \\r\\nSecurity  Operations  Center  Team  is  explained  and \\r\\nimplemented in this paper. In Figure 4, attackers cannot be so \\r\\nsure  whether  the  information in  the  table  are  affected by \\r\\nperturbation or its original values. Some of cells are added \\r\\nwith noise. perturbation tables (p-tables) are a goal of the Cell-\\r\\nkey  method. Jupyter  Notebook tool  and Python are \\r\\nimplemented to compute perturbation tables. The anonymizer server in Figure 2 was designed to allow \\r\\nusers to do queries online. Consistency is so important for \\r\\nonline service. The same user will get the same anonymized \\r\\ndataset  all  the  time;  therefore,  the Cell-key  perturbation \\r\\nmethod is a suitable answer for E-Commerce service. The \\r\\nserver performs data preparation in section 4 and then runs \\r\\nCell Key Perturbation in section 5. REFERENCES \\r\\n[1] D. Shahjee, N.

To\\r\\nthis end, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) in\\r\\naccordance with the guidelines for undertaking SLR and ana-\\r\\nlyzed papers published on SOCs between 2008 and 2018. We\\r\\nprovide a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced by\\r\\nSOC analysts and of the metrics suggested in the literature for\\r\\nmeasuring analysts performance. In addition, we present\\r\\na mapping between the challenges and existing performance\\r\\nmetrics showing how the effectiveness of an analyst in addres-\\r\\nsing a particular challenge could be measured. We also discuss\\r\\nthedrawbacksoftheexistingmetricsandsuggestdirectionsfor\\r\\nimprovement.

Setting up or operating a SOC is an expensive venture and\\r\\nbusinesses continually evaluate their return on security investment and how\\r\\nto improve overall performance [5]. Unfortunately, when it comes to assessing\\r\\nthe performance of SOCs, the industry generally rely on statistical data gener-\\r\\nated from deployed technological solutions such asfirewalls, Intrusion\\r\\nDetection Systems (IDSs’) and vulnerability scanners to determine or assess\\r\\nefficiencies [7]. The problem with this approach is that it fails to take into\\r\\nconsideration human factors (the human security analysts or people). People\\r\\n(SOC analysts) are key to maintaining deployed security controls, the investiga-\\r\\ntion of threats and incident management of all suspicious activities [8].\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"pJb3UnuD2sOv4/gotTFES9qHjrkkdkp4zLvB81c23ao=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"f875b96c-ac32-43ac-91e9-6e4bc713b353":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"f875b96c-ac32-43ac-91e9-6e4bc713b353\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf_3\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"YtIYv5YRSPjx2KMFZR4JVm97g1w+eMVuDA15RfqP56I=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"627e49e6-af04-4a18-8d32-1c0cb6bb089b\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"pJb3UnuD2sOv4/gotTFES9qHjrkkdkp4zLvB81c23ao=\"}},\"text\":\"Additionally, SOCs rely on a human to outsmart a malicious attacker [1].

McClain et al. [10], stress that analysts performance is a pertinent issue in\\r\\ncybersecurity as they play a crucial role in operating and maintaining the tools\\r\\nused by businesses to detect and respond to cyber threats. Analysts are\\r\\nexpected to monitor, detect, analyze and report cyber threat [6]. Also, analysts\\r\\nare supposed to have a greater cyber situational awareness and the necessary\\r\\nskills to detect attacks [4]. These responsibilities and tasks make it essential for\\r\\nanalysts to maintain a high standard of operational effectiveness and perfor-\\r\\nmance as a poor operational performance will hinder the overall efficiency of\\r\\na SOC [7]. One would expect analysts to receive various forms of support and\\r\\nongoing training to realize their objectives in the SOC. However, defending against cyber-attacks is not a trivial task and analysts face\\r\\nnumerous challenges, many of which affect their performance. For example, [8]\\r\\npoint out the complexity and intensity of the work of analysts. Similarly, the\\r\\nvolume of alerts/security events presented to the analysts, along with the multi-\\r\\nfaceted nature of cyber attacks all presents an enormous challenge to the analysts\\r\\n[4,11]. There are also issues and challenges arising from human factors such as\\r\\nstress level of the analysts, vigilance, mental workload, fatigue along with organi-\\r\\nsational processes and technological factors that impact on analysts performance\\r\\n[4,12]. While these may just be instances of what may well be part of a bigger\\r\\nproblem, and in some cases leading to analysts burnout [7,13,14], it remains\\r\\nunclear whether researchers and practitioners have a comprehensive insight into\\r\\nchallenges faced by analysts from human, organisational and technological\\r\\nperspective. Effort to understand the challenges faced by analysts are scattered across\\r\\nliterature, disjointed and often do not provide a comprehensive view of the\\r\\nissue. Hámornik and Krasznay [15], state that SOCs face internal and external\\r\\nissues.

We define a measure as a concrete, quantifiable\\r\\nand objective attribute such as the number of incidents raised by analysts and\\r\\na metric as an abstract, somewhat subjective attribute that can have many\\r\\nmeasures, for example, monitoring function metrics. In other words, measures\\r\\nsupport metrics [18]. The word performance in this context, as defined by the\\r\\nOxford English Dictionary, refers to the action or process of performing a task or\\r\\nfunction. Even though researchers have proposed various metrics for assessing the\\r\\neffectiveness and efficiency of a SOC, these assessment methods do not always\\r\\ntake analysts effort and performance into consideration. For example, Jacobs\\r\\net al. [2], presents a metric for evaluating the performance of a SOC based on the\\r\\ncapability services provided and maturity levels, but do not discuss assessment\\r\\nmethod (measures or metrics) for the analysts performance. Similarly, Schinagl,\\r\\nSchoon and Paans [1], also propose a performance metric for SOCs, but their\\r\\nwork does not adequately present a formal quantitative method for measuring\\r\\nthe efforts of analysts. Some scholars, however, have identified a number of\\r\\nways by which analysts efforts can be evaluated. These writers, however, often\\r\\ndo not differentiate between metrics and measures. In most cases, the terms\\r\\nmeasures and metrics are blurred and used interchangeably by the writers [5–7]. For example, some authors suggest the number of incidents raised or closed\\r\\nper day as a metric for the analysts [6]. Others focus on the time taken by an\\r\\nanalyst to detect an incident [5,7]. Based on our definition, these are measures\\r\\nrather than metrics. Moreover, analysts tasks are not limited to incidents raised\\r\\nor closed. The evidence from the literature also suggests that analysts are not\\r\\nsatisfied with this kind of measures as it does not take into consideration several\\r\\naspects of their work [7]. A much more worrying concern that literature posits is\\r\\nthat SOC Managers also lament about the lack of good metrics for assessing\\r\\nanalysts [7]. Despite the important role played by analysts, research continues to focus\\r\\nexclusively on building blocks for SOC, SOC framework and SOC technologies [1].

Notwithstanding, some scholars argue that a checklist cannot be used to assess\\r\\nquality [20]. However, from our perspective, using a single criterion allowed us\\r\\nto access a sufficient number of literature until saturation points where an\\r\\nadditional study will not provide any new information [31]. We initiallyassessed the quality ofeach paper by answering the questions from\\r\\nthe checklist and assigning scores based on a three-point scale of Yes (Y) = 1, No\\r\\nor Not Reported (N) = 0 and Partially (P) = 0.5 to calculate each paper’s quality\\r\\nindex.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"ULxy+VH1Tc7JvG0Ap2ne06ncANlvVdNHRoAgvEytwaA=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"dd3df184-a617-4ad0-bb8e-68d88ecbb9be":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"dd3df184-a617-4ad0-bb8e-68d88ecbb9be\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf_9\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"PboXCeXQLltd1t9P6HVG+rfJHo118Uj0OUK61ZXj8Nw=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"fc37ecd5-ff73-4537-9891-114dbc2c14b0\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"ULxy+VH1Tc7JvG0Ap2ne06ncANlvVdNHRoAgvEytwaA=\"}},\"text\":\"Given that there are 12 items on our Quality Assessment Checklist (QAC)\\r\\nshown inTable 3, each paper could obtain a score between 0 and 12.

A large\\r\\nvolume of alerts means analysts often struggle tofind true attacks among\\r\\nthe mist of many alerts. Onwubiko [6], points out that not all alerts lead to\\r\\nan incident as there are false incidents (false positives). Incidents are\\r\\nevents or alerts that pose a threat [36]. Limiting log collection to impor-\\r\\ntant assets/devices, policy tuning andfiltering out unnecessary alerts\\r\\n(noise) have been suggested by some writers/researchers as some of\\r\\nthe techniques that can be used to address these challenges [6]. Despite these recommendations, the evidence from the literature sug-\\r\\ngests that analysts continue to struggle when it comes to the volume of\\r\\nalerts they process [37]. ●False Positives (FPs)–FPs are reported by several authors as one of the\\r\\nmany challenges’analysts have to deal with (P1, P5, P6, P8, P10, P11 and\\r\\nP13). FP represents the number of‘false alarms’presented to the analysts\\r\\n[3,44]. These alarms are not true attacks (true positives) but are falsely\\r\\npresented to the analyst as though they are, causing them to initiate some\\r\\nform of investigation thereby wasting analyst time. 47% of the selected\\r\\npapers discuss the challenge posed by FPs and highlight that FPs contri-\\r\\nbute to the high number of alerts presented to the analysts. Like the\\r\\nvolume of alerts, FP’s are also the result of collecting too many logs. Lif\\r\\nand Sommestad [4], warn that too many FPs can result in an IDS operator\\r\\ncompletely ignoring alerts. Factors such as misconfiguration of systems\\r\\nand weak signature/detection strings designed by the vendor or the ana-\\r\\nlysts that incorrectly matches legitimate network traffic. Recommendation\\r\\nfor reducing FP include tuning policies and machine learning [38]. Businesses can also put in more efforts into addressing misconfiguration\\r\\nissues to reduce the burden on analysts. Tuning of policies and excluding\\r\\nfalse positive forms part of the work of an analyst [6]. ●False  Negatives (FNs)–FNs are also reported by 33% of the selected\\r\\npapers.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"6NyrdZDuBQzps51XggY+Yj6ZfLOzSrpnRYfaLD5rLL8=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"34f58a1b-46dc-4aba-8b0e-a9a938ddf1e0":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"34f58a1b-46dc-4aba-8b0e-a9a938ddf1e0\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf_13\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"WB7acIMtZzqwI1/AQxffHWLVTNQC5+IDfUqL9l1m/Xc=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"dcb67aa2-c88e-4bba-ae23-ca19de770717\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"6NyrdZDuBQzps51XggY+Yj6ZfLOzSrpnRYfaLD5rLL8=\"}},\"text\":\"P6, P8, P10, P11 and P13 all identify false negative as one of the\\r\\nchallenges faced by the analyst.

Along with this,\\r\\nanalysts are also under time pressure during incident handling [15]. Identifying an attack is one thing; handling the attack through the incident\\r\\nhandling process is another [36]. Both P4 and P10 suggest that detecting\\r\\nand managing security incidents (attack) is crucial for the success of a SOC. Incident management typically involves engaging with (or escalations to)\\r\\nother teams, internal or external to the organisation, to ensure that the\\r\\nimpact of any attack is minimised or removed [41]. The complexity of\\r\\nincident handling can be daunting for less experienced analysts which\\r\\nmeans they rely on the guidance of experienced analysts. With studies\\r\\nsuggesting SOCs struggling to retain experienced analysts, handling com-\\r\\nplex incidents becomes a challenge [10]. ●Skills/Experience Shortage–(P3, P4, P5, P12 and P15) highlight skills and\\r\\nexperience shortages are among the challenges facing the analysts. The\\r\\nrapid turnover of analysts means SOCs struggle to retain their most experi-\\r\\nenced and qualified analysts [1]. This creates a challenge for less experi-\\r\\nenced analysts as the opportunity to learn from experienced analysts\\r\\nbecomes an issue. The dynamic nature of cyber threats means that unless\\r\\nanalysts receive periodic training, either in-house or off-site paid training,\\r\\nthey are unlikely to possess that skills required to beat offan attacker [7]. ●Inadequate  Communication  between  Teams–P1 reports inadequate\\r\\ncommunicate between analysts as one of the challenges in SOCs [5]. Hámornik & Krasznay [15],explains that communication and information\\r\\nsharing is vital to the success of a SOC although they argue that team\\r\\nmembers generally do not have time to communicate when they are under\\r\\npressure. The lack of effective communication between the team impact on\\r\\nthe team’s performance [15]. Sundaramurthy et al. [7], state that SOCs must\\r\\nwork towards addressing the lack of communication so that analysts do not\\r\\nfeel left behind or isolated. ●Tacit  Knowledge–The problem with tacit knowledge is that it is not\\r\\nlimited to SOC environment as many professions also have a similar issue\\r\\n[42].\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"rnxx6rEbLGlq3EhYD2zeDE/faprPj2S3pe3DMZwK4wg=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"3511205c-3405-4202-af2b-5252e6d36afe":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"3511205c-3405-4202-af2b-5252e6d36afe\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":14,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf_14\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":14,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"gch/hCiaRUZazM9prKhgKqHcrXyqGllgGWhwYSfBMrA=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"1e41b144-4bd4-42d2-9ad2-3af05c2bb24a\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":14,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"rnxx6rEbLGlq3EhYD2zeDE/faprPj2S3pe3DMZwK4wg=\"}},\"text\":\"However, within a SOC environment, P2 and P11 highlight that tacit\\r\\nknowledge can hinder or slow down the investigation in the SOC.

The use of SIEM (Security Information and\\r\\nEvent Management) technologies along with security event visualisation\\r\\nsystems can ease offsome of the burden associated with manual and\\r\\nrepetitive processes [1,2]. ●Workloads–Sundaramurthy and his colleagues [43],argue that analysts\\r\\nare confronted with more alerts than they can investigate. This view is\\r\\nsupported by Feng et al. [38], who suggest that increased workload is\\r\\nmainly due to the overwhelming number of alerts analysts have to process. P3, P6, P7, P10, P9, P13, P14 and P15 all identify workload as a major\\r\\nchallenge faced by analysts.

Our focus is on the analyst performance metric, i.e. metric that measures how well the analyst performs. We noted that there are\\r\\nlimited metrics for measuring analyst performance and this has been attributed\\r\\nto the difficulty in devising a useful metric, as managers do not even know what\\r\\nthe right metric should be [7]. Ten of the selected papers (P1, P2, P5, P6, P7, P9,\\r\\nP11, P12, P13, P14) identify and reports on various metrics that are frequently\\r\\nused to measure analysts performance. As pointed out earlier, authors do not always make the distinction between\\r\\nmetrics and measures and use the terms interchangeably. To that end, we\\r\\ngrouped existing assessment methods into quantitative and qualitative metrics/\\r\\nmeasures. The quantitative metrics/measures are less open to interpretation and\\r\\nprovide concrete measures, unlike the qualitative metricsthat usesnon-numerical\\r\\nand interpretive approach. The quantitative metrics identified are:\\r\\n●Time to Detect an Incident (TTD) or Average Time to Detect (ATTD)–\\r\\nThis metric focuses on the delta (time) between an issue occurring and the\\r\\nanalyst noticing it as identified in P1 and P11. It takes into consideration the\\r\\ntime an alert is detected by a detection tool, such as an Intrusion Detection\\r\\nSystem (IDS) or a SIEM, and the time that the analyst discovers it. ●Average  Time  Taken  to  Respond  (ATTR)–ATTR focuses on the time\\r\\ntaken by an analyst to respond to an incident as reported in P12 and P14. Unlike ATTD, ATTR assesses response time rather than detection time. Responding may entail specific action such as reconfiguring a network to\\r\\nstop any threat. Some authors refer to this as the Average Total Time for\\r\\nAlert (avgTTA) Investigation [47]. Others refer to this as the time taken to\\r\\ninvestigate a customer under attack [39]. The time-based metrics focus on\\r\\nanalysts reaction times, in terms of how quick they respond or detect an\\r\\nincident. ●Number of Alerts Analysed/Unanalysed by an analyst at the end of\\r\\na shift–This measure, focuses on counting the number of alerts processed\\r\\nby the analysts as identified in P6 and P14.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"SEVANcto3p7uz1Q7jRRSbKF3DJPQhqVtVPziw4Jdmco=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"64f6bad2-aa3e-44ad-9422-c5be3f255a9d":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"64f6bad2-aa3e-44ad-9422-c5be3f255a9d\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":16,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf_16\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":16,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"cyt7EM/TW2wfSLXRLZU/0MmurBOk/ELkuH5w9gPGrAM=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"ec069782-38eb-48ea-b151-fba3d0bf9c24\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":16,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"SEVANcto3p7uz1Q7jRRSbKF3DJPQhqVtVPziw4Jdmco=\"}},\"text\":\"These metrics do not take into\\r\\nconsideration the complexity of the alert [43]. ●The number of tickets closed per day–This metric merely counts the\\r\\nnumber of tickets closed by the analyst at the end of the day (P7, P9).

Looking atFigure 4, it is evident that several metrics exist to measure analysts’\\r\\nefforts as they tackle many of the challenging aspects of their work. A one-way\\r\\narrow is used to illustrate the relationship between the metrics and the chal-\\r\\nlenges.

Indeed, all the metrics showed inFigure 4can\\r\\nbe used to evaluate how well the analysts are performing, albeit they are dis-\\r\\njointed and unless a SOC implements multiple metrics, it will be hard to get\\r\\na holistic view of analysts’effort. Notwithstanding, measuring human factors such\\r\\nas analystssituational awareness,vigilanceand attentionare also important to get\\r\\na holistic view of analysts performance [4]. Discussion\\r\\nAlthough SOCs have been an active research area, the challenges faced by\\r\\nanalysts and performance metrics for analysts are usually mentioned by\\r\\nresearchers in passing and are rarely the main focus. This is discouraging\\r\\nbecause challenges faced by analysts impacts on the performance of the SOC\\r\\n[44]. Identification of specific challenges faced by analysts will provide SOC\\r\\nexperts with an opportunity to learn and facilitate the development of novel\\r\\napproaches to helping analysts address these challenges. Likewise, measuring\\r\\nthe performance of an analyst is important because anything that is not mea-\\r\\nsured cannot be managed [9]. From a practical perspective, an objective per-\\r\\nformance metric can be used by the analyst for self-assessment to establish how\\r\\nwell they are contributing to the team’s objective. SOC managers can also use\\r\\nobjective performance metrics to evaluate analysts’performance and to moti-\\r\\nvate them [7]. Many of the challenges faced by the analyst pointed out in the papers\\r\\nreviewed, play into the hands of an attacker. For example, over 40% of the\\r\\npapers reviewed reported the volume of alerts received by an analyst as\\r\\na critical issue. Although collecting system events logs can provide valuable\\r\\ninformation about an attacker’s activities, in practice large volume of alerts also\\r\\nmeans that the analysts have to go through thousands of alerts to detect\\r\\na single true attack if any [7]. Attackers can easily blend in among the mist of\\r\\nseveral logs. Recommendations such as collecting essential logs, designing\\r\\nuseful use cases (UC’s) and using pre-defined correlation rules in SIEM solutions,\\r\\ndo not seem to address this challenge [50,44]. While it is acknowledged that\\r\\nanalysts cannot possibly investigate all alerts and that some level of automation\\r\\nis required, tuning policies can help analysts to manage alert volumes.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"6YGMacdBr1WkM+gkqgcxx56r+DgcwHCtsSCO/HEgX4A=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"aaa13468-23b3-46e1-8953-e369e42d44b3":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"aaa13468-23b3-46e1-8953-e369e42d44b3\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":20,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf_20\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":20,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"SE/z1tK4ZKPJ+HoTMGO9zW95yMpq1JwBSvGFuzzrh30=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"4eabb069-ab95-4cba-9e03-2b727acb1f08\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":20,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"6YGMacdBr1WkM+gkqgcxx56r+DgcwHCtsSCO/HEgX4A=\"}},\"text\":\"Interestingly, to the best of our knowledge, analysts coping strategies when it\\r\\ncomes to managing a large volume of alerts have not been studied or addressed\\r\\nbefore in literature.

Future metrics, there-\\r\\nfore, must take this into consideration. Another area of concern is analyst burnout, which research shows lead to\\r\\nhigh analyst turnover. According to Sundaramurthy et al. [7,12], negative factors\\r\\nsuch as low skills, the lack of empowerment, low growth and low creativity in\\r\\nSOCs lead to analyst burnout. They propose a model to explain the burned-out\\r\\nphenomena among analysts. However, the completeness of the model was not\\r\\nadequately verified due to the lack of analysts to participate in the study.

For example, dealing\\r\\nwith sophisticated attacks and false positives [52]. Notwithstanding, none of the\\r\\npapers reviewed provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced by\\r\\nthe analyst. We argue that further research is needed tofill this gap and to\\r\\nvalidate prior work. The paper at hand is a stepping stone towards this goal. When it comes to measuring analyst performance, our review suggests that\\r\\nvarious metrics exist for doing this; however, some authors argue about their\\r\\ncompleteness and objectivity and make a case for the need for further research in\\r\\nthis area [5].

In fact, such a metric does not\\r\\nprovide enough information to differentiate two or more analysts raising the\\r\\nsame number of incidents, assuming one is raising critical incidents, and another\\r\\nis raising false positives or lower priority alerts. Sundaramurthy et al. [5],stress\\r\\nthat priority should be given to alerts that pose a direct threat. A metric that\\r\\nmerely counts the number of incidents raised by analysts as shown inFigure 4\\r\\nmay suggest that the analysts are on par. However, in reality, some analysts may\\r\\nchoose to raise or close a high quantity of easy tickets to look good on such\\r\\na metric [43]. Shah et al.

One hundred and twenty-one (121)\\r\\npapers were initially selected as part of our SLR process; however, only 15\\r\\nstudies were included, based on our review protocol and criteria. In this study, we identified twelve (12) challenges faced by analysts and\\r\\nreport them as: the volume of alerts presented to the analyst; the number of\\r\\nfalse positive alerts; false negatives; sophisticated attacks; incident handling/\\r\\nincident management complexity; skills/experience shortage; inadequate com-\\r\\nmunication between teams; tacit knowledge; manual and repetitive processes;\\r\\nworkloads; analysts burnout and the lack of adequate metrics and measures for\\r\\nassessing the efforts of analysts. We also identified the following metrics and\\r\\nmeasures for assessing the performance of analysts: time to detect an incident/\\r\\naverage time to detect an incident, average time taken to respond to an\\r\\nincident, number of alerts analysed/unanalysed by an analyst at the end of\\r\\na shift, the number of tickets closed per day, the number of incidents detected\\r\\nwithin a specific timeframe, time spent on operations by the analyst, time spent\\r\\non each ticket, a measure of the competency and experience of the analysts,\\r\\nsuccess stories, the quality of incident reports and the quality of analysis.

ABSTRACT\\r\\nIncident Response Planning (IRP1) is essential for effective\\r\\ncybersecurity  management,  requiring  detailed  documentation\\r\\n(orplaybooks)  to  guide  security  personnel  during  incidents. Yet,  creating  comprehensive  IRPs  is  often  hindered  by  chal-\\r\\nlenges  such  as  complex  systems,  high  turnover  rates,  and\\r\\nlegacy technologies lacking documentation. This paper argues\\r\\nthat,  despite  these  obstacles,  the  development,  review,  and\\r\\nrefinement of IRPs can be significantly enhanced through the\\r\\nutilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. By  leveraging  LLMs  for  tasks  such  as  drafting  initial  plans,\\r\\nsuggesting best practices, and identifying documentation gaps,\\r\\norganizations can overcome resource constraints and improve\\r\\ntheir  readiness  for  cybersecurity  incidents. We  discuss  the\\r\\npotential  of  LLMs  to  streamline  IRP  processes,  while  also\\r\\nconsidering the limitations and the need for human oversight in\\r\\nensuring the accuracy and relevance of generated content. Our\\r\\nfindings contribute to the cybersecurity field by demonstrating\\r\\na  novel  approach  to  enhancing  IRP  with  AI  technologies,\\r\\noffering practical insights for organizations seeking to bolster\\r\\ntheir incident response capabilities. II. INTRODUCTION\\r\\nIn an era where digital threats evolve with increasing sophis-\\r\\ntication, the need for robust (cybersecurity) Incident Response\\r\\nPlans  (IRPs)  and  appropriate  Standard  Operating  Procedures\\r\\n(SOPs) has never been more critical. Incident Response Plans\\r\\nare the broad outline of what an organization may need to do\\r\\nto recover from various failures such as a malware infestation.

This  section  explores  the  criticality  of  setting  and\\r\\nadhering to time-bound objectives in crafting IRPs and SOPs,\\r\\nwith a focus on leveraging LLMs to streamline this process. 1)  Setting  Realistic  Timelines:A  thorough  assessment  of\\r\\nan  organization’s  existing  incident  response  capabilities  and\\r\\nresources  lays  the  groundwork  for  realistic  timeline  setting. Understanding the starting point is essential for accurate plan-\\r\\nning and expectation management. LLMs excel in identifying\\r\\ngaps within existing IRPs and SOPs by analyzing vast amounts\\r\\nof  data  and  comparing  them  with  current  best  practices  and\\r\\ncompliance standards. This capability allows organizations to\\r\\nidentify gaps within the procedures on which new procedures\\r\\nare being built.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"coIKLZZvKrdF1vYNDbxGf/kmZzqrNkILC2r7i26sBWk=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"664fbd5e-081a-4669-b14a-243e4c013977":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"664fbd5e-081a-4669-b14a-243e4c013977\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":8,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf_8\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":8,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"cLxB9P+F3TqbbcAqlV7vMktw2EuyUtM85kGHjvH07Bo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"e45b7f10-8968-4557-b401-b6ff0c8d6a25\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":8,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"coIKLZZvKrdF1vYNDbxGf/kmZzqrNkILC2r7i26sBWk=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"afcce9ec-e7ea-4056-9130-e0bd1e7a510d\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":8,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"lD4vNBcV1vd4MGxALos3Xc+h/Hou5pjAEnZjIgNOnnM=\"}},\"text\":\"This capability allows organizations to\\r\\nidentify gaps within the procedures on which new procedures\\r\\nare being built. This helps identify antecedent tasks that may\\r\\nbe needed before those under consideration can be built. LLMs  can  dramatically  reduce  the  time  required  to  draft\\r\\ncomprehensive  IRPs  and  SOPs. By  inputting  organizational\\r\\nspecifics  and  compliance  requirements,  LLMs  can  generate\\r\\ninitial  drafts  that  teams  can  refine,  significantly  accelerating\\r\\nthe development process. 2)  Incorporating Time-bound Goals into IRP/SOP Develop-\\r\\nment:Establishing specific milestones within the IRP and SOP\\r\\ndevelopment  process  is  crucial. For  instance,  completing  the\\r\\ndraft of an IRP within four weeks or finalizing a set of SOPs by\\r\\nthe end of the quarter provides clear targets for the team to aim\\r\\nfor. Furthermore, allocating time for feedback and revisions is\\r\\nessential for an iterative approach aiming to optimize the plan. Setting clear deadlines for each review phase ensures that the\\r\\ndevelopment  process  remains  on  track,  allowing  for  iterative\\r\\nimprovements without derailing the overall timeline. The unexpected can occur in the security space, which may\\r\\nnegatively impact the timeline. To reduce the risk of missing\\r\\na deadline due to unplanned higher-priority tasks, scheduling\\r\\nregular  progress  reviews  helps  monitor  the  advancement  of\\r\\nIRP  and  SOP  development  against  the  established  timeline.

In this work we collaborate with a commer-\\r\\ncial SOC to devise a 4-stage (network) threat analysis process\\r\\nto support the collection and analysis of relevant information\\r\\nfor threat analysis. We conduct an experiment with ten T1 an-\\r\\nalysts employed in the SOC and show that analysts following\\r\\nthe proposed process are 2.5 times more likely to produce an\\r\\naccurate assessment than analysts who do not. We evaluate\\r\\nqualitatively the effects of the process on analysts decisions,\\r\\nand discuss implications for practice and research. 1  Introduction\\r\\nAs the volume and sophistication of cyber-attacks increase,\\r\\nthe security of networks and systems is of key societal and\\r\\neconomic importance.Security Operation Centers(SOCs)\\r\\nare business units (within a larger organizational setting), or\\r\\nservices (that typically sell managed security services such\\r\\nas security monitoring to third party organizations) whose\\r\\npurpose is to detect cyber-attacks within the monitored envi-\\r\\nronments.

The\\r\\nsecurity services provided by SOCs can range from network\\r\\nintrusion detection systems (NIDS), to endpoint detection\\r\\nand firewall monitoring.

Naturally, the quality\\r\\nof the analysis and thus the accuracy of the classification is\\r\\ndependent on the individual skill of the analyst. However, ex-\\r\\nternal factors can impact this significantly, such as the arrival\\r\\nof external vulnerability information, or the addition of a new\\r\\nnetwork segment in scope of an analyst’s monitoring.

The authors conduct CTA\\r\\nto capture fine-grained processes performed as part of the\\r\\nalert analysis. Interestingly, the authors highlight the obser-\\r\\nvation that analysts employ different strategies and processes\\r\\nto explore the data and generate hypotheses to investigate. In\\r\\nlater work Zhong et al. [30] propose a tool that automates\\r\\nthe data triage aspect of aT1 analyst’s work. They observed\\r\\nhigh-performance and satisfactory false-positive rates. They\\r\\ndo note, however, that the quality of the system depends on\\r\\nthe quality of the triage traces, which in turn depends on the\\r\\nquality of the analyst. Notably, this approach utilizes the op-\\r\\nerations of the analysts, such as “searching”,“selecting” and\\r\\n“filtering” [30], and does not capture why an analyst performs\\r\\nthis action, nor what evidence is obtained from this operation. Kokulu et al. conducted a qualitative study on issues within\\r\\nthe SOC [14]. One of the primary findings is the current\\r\\nmetrics for SOC performance are not effective. Moreover,\\r\\nthis is a point of contention between security analysts and\\r\\ntheir managers.

Additionally, they noted that\\r\\npoor analyst training and high false-positive rates are issues\\r\\nwithin the SOCs in their research. This all culminates into\\r\\npoor quality of analyses, if left unaddressed. Another interesting observation noted by Sunderamurthy\\r\\net al [23] is the problem of tacit knowledge within the SOC;\\r\\ndecisions made by security analysts are based on intuition and\\r\\nnot documented. Often, the security analysts cannot clearly\\r\\ncommunicate their knowledge related to the incident and the\\r\\nreason for their classification of this incident [23]. This is\\r\\na key component of the services provided by SOCs, as the\\r\\ncontact point for the monitored environment must be provided\\r\\nwith accurate and actionable evidence of a security incident.

This process was then iteratively and independently evalu-\\r\\nated by two senior analysts (with respectively 15+ and 10+\\r\\nyears of experience) active in the SOC, until all three experts\\r\\nwere in agreement on the resulting threat analysis process. Implementation details and results are given in Section5. RQ2. To validate the identified threat analysis process we\\r\\ndesigned an experiment to compare the performance of SOC\\r\\nanalysts who employ the process to conduct analysis of alert\\r\\ndata in the SOC, against that of analysts who do not.

We then recruited ten T1 analysts and asked\\r\\nthem to analyse four batches of alerts each (for a total 80 alert\\r\\nanalyses per analyst);3each analyst was assigned to either the\\r\\ntreatment group (i.e., following the proposed process for the\\r\\nanalysis) or the control group, and asked to classify each alert\\r\\nas either ‘interesting’ or ‘not interesting’. These assessments\\r\\nare then compared against a ground truth of assessments (de-\\r\\nfined by the SOC’s T2 analyst) to evaluate differences in\\r\\naccuracy between the treatment and control groups. In the fol-\\r\\nlowing, we describe our choice of subjects, how we designed\\r\\nthe sets of alerts per subject, how we derived the ground truth\\r\\nand the details of the experimental setup. Subjects.We recruited as subjects of our experiment ten ju-\\r\\nnior analysts over a period of six months, in two batches of\\r\\nfive analysts each. To maintain comparable experience levels\\r\\nacross recruited analysts, we recruited them immediately after\\r\\nthey joined the SOC. T1 analysts in the SOC are structurally\\r\\nhired as interns from the security program at a technical uni-\\r\\nversity in Europe. Their turnover rate varies between four\\r\\nand six months of employment.4All subjects are assessed be-\\r\\nfore joining the team for their background, and are given the\\r\\nsame technical on-the-job training. Analysts in the treatment\\r\\ngroup were given an additional training on the devised threat\\r\\nanalysis process they will employ during the experiment.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"QWDnLillpEWfCUpemYRvGXer2N902OG7MZw0cSVWCPQ=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"c2fd0132-7710-423f-b708-5a64793017e8":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"c2fd0132-7710-423f-b708-5a64793017e8\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":6,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf_6\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":6,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"t3VZLu/2BvxwzBKqQ/34xY4OL8QTabMNCWvDqviIHYk=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"d61ab5e7-714b-4fa3-a387-febc22e5779a\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":6,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"QWDnLillpEWfCUpemYRvGXer2N902OG7MZw0cSVWCPQ=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"273f870d-d4b2-4092-ac18-0748b54365a1\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":6,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"cfQxDsAvLBhi7+JcfQcdEOzUb6+Rlyer4ManDTURnqw=\"}},\"text\":\"Designing alert sets.Collecting ‘baseline’ alert data.To\\r\\nmaintain realism of the experimental setup, we collected\\r\\nalerts from the network environment of a customer of the\\r\\nSOC over the course of 2.5 weeks.

Customer scope.The analyst determines if the alert is\\r\\nwithin the monitored scope by reviewing if necessary the cus-\\r\\ntomer security policy, as well as the service level agreements\\r\\nabout sub-nets and reporting. The alerts with no to low impact,\\r\\nfor example a guest network of the customer, can in this way\\r\\nbe evaluated early on in the process as lower priority. 5.2  Additional alerts. The second stage consists of two steps; alert history (AH) and\\r\\nsurrounding alerts (SA). Alert history.The analyst investigates the history of the\\r\\nalert under investigation. Namely, how often the alert has been\\r\\ntriggered in the past, how often it was considered interesting,\\r\\nand whether it triggered for the same internal host before. Using this information, an analyst can verify quickly whether\\r\\nthe observed alert is a common false positive or not. If past\\r\\noccurrences have been flagged as ‘not interesting’ due to them\\r\\nbeing false positives, the analyst can consider that the alert\\r\\nunder investigation may be a false positive as well. Surrounding alerts.The analyst investigates additional\\r\\nalerts similar to the one under investigation that were triggered\\r\\nby one or multiple of the involved hosts, around the time of\\r\\nthe potential attack. When looking at these surrounding alerts,\\r\\nanalysts may observe different alerts with similar names, indi-\\r\\ncating the same potential attack. This adds evidence that the\\r\\nevent underlying these alerts may be interesting. Additionally\\r\\nthe analyst may observe alerts for different phases of an attack,\\r\\nfurther strengthening the case for continuing to investigate the\\r\\nalert.

Further-\\r\\nmore, any other logs generated by the receiving host of the\\r\\nprotocol in the alert, or DNS logs, are typically related. Traffic stream information.The analyst considers more\\r\\ndetailed information about the packets sent to and from the\\r\\nhost. This information can include the total number of bytes\\r\\nand packets sent by the attacker and defender, and the data\\r\\ncontained in those packets. The protocol used between the\\r\\ncommunication of the attacker and defender is an important\\r\\nconsideration in this step as it determines whether the number\\r\\nof packets and the data contained in them are abnormal or not\\r\\nin the specific context. For example, this step allows analysts\\r\\nto identify successful port scans by verifying if a response\\r\\npacket was sent back to the source. This also allows analysts\\r\\nto determine whether any ‘lucky hits’, were generated. A\\r\\n‘lucky hit’ occurs when the trigger conditions of a signature\\r\\n(typically a non-specific one, as assessed in theSiSstep) are\\r\\nmet by pure chance on a random sequence of bytes, and thus\\r\\ntrigger on benign traffic, producing false-positives.

This step can vary\\r\\ngreatly from SOC to SOC and even from monitored environ-\\r\\nment to monitored environment, as corporate policies differ\\r\\nbetween organizations. Target host behaviour.Next to utilizing known informa-\\r\\ntion about the targeted host, the analyst reviews the current\\r\\nbehaviorof the targeted host.

Attack/Exploit information.In this step, the analyst de-\\r\\ntermines the exact attack and tools involved. The information\\r\\nrequired to determine this originates from the signature which\\r\\ntriggered the alert, and open source information about the cor-\\r\\nresponding attack. From this step, it should be clear whether\\r\\nthere is an attack, and if so what attack specifically. Using\\r\\nthis information, in relation to that collected in the previous\\r\\nsteps (e.g.RL,THI) the analyst estimates how this specific\\r\\nattack can have impact on the customer. Attacker information.The analyst investigates the be-\\r\\nhaviour of the attacker (or at least of the attacking system). Using the logs generated as a result of the attacker behaviour,\\r\\nas well as using public sources, the analyst can determine\\r\\nwhether the attacker is an actual attacker. This step is needed\\r\\nto rule out known and trusted sources such as (vulnerabil-\\r\\nity) scanners, as well as help identifying false positive alerts\\r\\ngenerating ‘hits’ on backup streams, software updates, and\\r\\nbenign network downloads. Attack success indicators.The analyst investigates\\r\\nwhether the attack was successful. Analysts use information\\r\\nobtained from former stages and open sources that identify\\r\\nclear indicators of successful attacks. Generally, the attack\\r\\nsuccess indicators are highly dependent on the specific attack,\\r\\nhowever, generic indicators such as DNS requests for unusual\\r\\ntop-level domains or internal scanning can be used as well. Relation to use cases.The analyst consults the use cases\\r\\nfor the affected environment. This step helps them to correctly\\r\\nidentify the full impact for the environment, and thus the\\r\\nfinal classification of the alert. It also eliminates any alerts\\r\\nwhich are not important to the environment.

The coefficient ofProcessis 0.98 with a p-value of 0.035,\\r\\nshowing that analysts following the proposed threat analysis\\r\\nprocess were significantly more likely to classify alerts cor-\\r\\nrectly than analysts in the control group.

To reconstruct this, we look at the\\r\\ndata annotated by the analysts with the motivations of their\\r\\ndecisions for a classification for each specific alert. Firstly, from the data we observed that subjects who do not\\r\\nfollow our process typically based their decision to discard an\\r\\nalert (i.e classifying it as ‘not interesting’) after a single ‘step’\\r\\nin the decision process. For example, aCnCalert (ThreatFox\\r\\nBazarBackdoor botnet C2 traffic, whose instance in\\r\\nour data is classified as ‘interesting’ by the T2 analyst) in\\r\\nscenario no. 3 was erroneously classified by an analyst as ‘not\\r\\ninteresting’ as the network communication related to this alert\\r\\n“only” contained 10 packets.

Internal validity.We assume in our experiment that all our\\r\\nsubjects are equally skilled in analyzing security events and\\r\\ndo not influence the accuracy of the classifications. How-\\r\\never, in reality some analysts may be more skilled than others\\r\\ndespite similar job experiences and educational background. To mitigate this, we checked whether concrete evidence ex-\\r\\nists that analysts influence the classification of the alerts or\\r\\nnot. Additionally, when collecting data regarding the internal\\r\\nconsistency of our process we used the response options in\\r\\nTable7in the Appendix.

In other words, subjects may give different responses\\r\\nto a step with the same observed data. Meanwhile, subjects\\r\\nmay give identical responses to a step even though they have\\r\\ninterpreted the data completely differently. External validity.The main threat to external validity is the\\r\\nextent to which the employed SOC represents data and oper-\\r\\nations adopted by other SOCs. SOCs vary widely over both\\r\\ndimensions as they employ different technologies and sen-\\r\\nsors, SOC operations are not standardized, and by monitoring\\r\\ndifferent networks/infrastructures they may evaluate different\\r\\nalerts over different environments [25]. However, virtually\\r\\nall SOCs at least monitor network traffic [6,16,27] and typ-\\r\\nically employ junior T1 analysts as a first line of defense to\\r\\ndecide whether to escalate or ignore incoming alerts [25]. As\\r\\nthe SOC under analysis performs only network analysis, and\\r\\nemploys T1 analysts from the same ‘pool’ as most SOCs (i.e.,\\r\\njunior staff in need of specialized cybersecurity training to\\r\\noperate well within a SOC [25]) we consider it to be represen-\\r\\ntative of SOCs in general, over these two dimensions. Further,\\r\\nas the SOC under analysisonlyperforms network monitoring,\\r\\nwe can evaluate model effects without additional confounding\\r\\nfactors caused by multiple data sources (e.g. system host logs). Whereas this suggests that our finding that a structured analy-\\r\\nsis process can help analysts in making accurate evaluations\\r\\nover network alerts, effect sizes may vary significantly across\\r\\nSOCs.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"3MI+MYxkKv/sJY8gy4It0LrB0y+V6cU7KB8pwUIoYDg=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"80b57997-8d4a-4628-ad19-07459673801d":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"80b57997-8d4a-4628-ad19-07459673801d\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf_13\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"4Lzse5TGSWEGordmxFzZEmzXeKbeT0lT77qA484YMxw=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"6ad5ac3b-cdb1-4e6a-a72b-ce7bef3124a6\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"3MI+MYxkKv/sJY8gy4It0LrB0y+V6cU7KB8pwUIoYDg=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"b2ee01ab-b35d-4b20-911e-8940f771c261\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"h3KMT8XDUpfOIAfSMhJ4ntDSV44Uy0aNWtiJHhgrpvI=\"}},\"text\":\"Further research is needed to derive and evaluate analy-\\r\\nsis processes across different SOCs, monitored environments,\\r\\nand monitoring technologies, and their interactions. Addition-\\r\\nally, whereas the collaborating SOC only allows two possible\\r\\nclassifications for T1 analysts, past research [21] show that\\r\\nother SOCs may have more options to classify an alert. Our\\r\\nthreat analysis process does not incorporate such frameworks\\r\\nfor classifying alerts and thus, our process requires modifica-\\r\\ntion to accommodate different classification systems. 8  Conclusions\\r\\nIn this work we devised a threat analysis process to attempt\\r\\nto structure the work process of T1 SOC analysts. Our threat\\r\\nanalysis process consists of four stages where it guides the\\r\\nanalyst into collecting information relevant for their analysis. Furthermore, we conducted an experiment using real alert\\r\\ndata with ten T1 analysts working in a commercial SOC to\\r\\ninvestigate the effect of structuring the threat analysis pro-\\r\\ncess. Our results show that our process increases the odds\\r\\nof our subjects correctly classifying an alert by 167%. More\\r\\nspecifically, we observed that alerts correlated with a cyber\\r\\nattack are the alerts who significantly benefit from using our\\r\\nthreat analysis process. Overall, our study suggests that struc-\\r\\nturing the analysis process of a T1 analyst aid in the correct\\r\\nclassification of security alerts.

An  \\\"Intrusion  Detection \\r\\nHoneypot\\\"  (IDH)  is  essentially  a  combination  of  two \\r\\nconcepts  (Intrusion  Detection  System  and  Honeypot) \\r\\nwhere  the  honeypot  system  is  a  part  of  an  intrusion \\r\\ndetection strategy.

To ensure \\r\\ndata in transit is encrypted and authenticated, we encapsulate it \\r\\nin a Wireguard VPN tunnel, resulting a cost effective platform \\r\\nthat detects and analyzes cybersecurity threats [8]. We  use  GNS3  Network  Emulator  to  simulate  and  test  this \\r\\ntype  of  platform  and  validate  our  approach  (Fig. 3).

\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nWHAT IS A SOC? A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized unit within an organization dedicated to monitoring, \\r\\ndetecting, responding to, and mitigating cybersecurity threats. Its primary objective is to safeguard the \\r\\norganization's information systems, networks, and data from a spectrum of cyber threats, including malware, \\r\\nphishing attacks, and unauthorized access. Equipped with advanced technologies and skilled cybersecurity professionals, a SOC continuously analyzes \\r\\nand correlates vast amounts of security data generated by network devices, applications, and endpoints. The \\r\\nSOC employs Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, intrusion detection systems, and \\r\\nother technologies to identify anomalies and potential security incidents. In the event of a security incident, the SOC's expert analysts coordinate incident response efforts, employing \\r\\npredefined playbooks and response plans. The SOC's role extends beyond mere incident detection; it \\r\\nactively works to mitigate and remediate security threats, minimizing potential damage and ensuring the \\r\\norganization's resilience against cyberattacks. Regularly updating its methodologies, technologies, and \\r\\nresponse strategies, a SOC plays a pivotal role in maintaining a proactive and adaptive cybersecurity posture \\r\\nin the face of evolving cyber threats. SOC BENEFITS \\r\\n \\r\\nA Security Operations Center (SOC) is a critical component of modern cybersecurity strategies, playing a \\r\\npivotal role in safeguarding organizations against a myriad of cyber threats. Its importance is multifaceted, \\r\\naddressing the dynamic nature of the digital landscape and the evolving tactics employed by malicious \\r\\nactors. Central to a SOC's significance is its ability to provide early threat detection. By continuously monitoring \\r\\nnetwork activities and leveraging advanced technologies such as Security Information and Event \\r\\nManagement (SIEM) systems, intrusion detection systems, and endpoint protection tools, a SOC can \\r\\nidentify anomalies and potential security incidents in real-time. This early detection is instrumental in \\r\\npreventing cyber threats from escalating into major breaches. The SOC's capability for rapid incident response is equally crucial. In the event of a security incident, the \\r\\nSOC's dedicated incident response teams can execute predefined playbooks and response plans. This agility \\r\\nminimizes the impact of security breaches, mitigates risks swiftly, and prevents the spread of malicious \\r\\nactivities. Continuous monitoring is a cornerstone of a SOC's operation. This ensures vigilant oversight of an \\r\\norganization's digital assets, allowing security professionals to respond promptly to emerging threats, \\r\\nunauthorized access attempts, and abnormal activities within the network.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"b50ftK84eu/xfUww5dzm2jXKVnCwohZOezfUMPZzwhw=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"6399fa94-f16a-4403-b059-2346cebfb4b0":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"6399fa94-f16a-4403-b059-2346cebfb4b0\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":7,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf_7\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":7,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"8XNkYVoF4Aqj5obQpULmwLF9/PiY6HlzFyfUgjcInww=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"7e6150c9-aa14-439b-a66e-a638035c5742\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":7,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"b50ftK84eu/xfUww5dzm2jXKVnCwohZOezfUMPZzwhw=\"}},\"text\":\"Integration of threat intelligence \\r\\nfeeds enhances a SOC's proactive defense capabilities.

IDS/IPS \\r\\n \\r\\nIn the realm of cybersecurity, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are \\r\\ncrucial components designed to identify and respond to potential security threats within a network. These \\r\\nsystems play pivotal roles in proactively safeguarding digital assets, ensuring the integrity and \\r\\nconfidentiality of data, and mitigating the risks associated with cyberattacks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): \\r\\n \\r\\nAn IDS is a monitoring tool that scrutinizes network and/or system activities to detect and alert on \\r\\nsuspicious or anomalous behavior. The primary objective is to identify potential security incidents by \\r\\nanalyzing patterns and deviations from established baselines. IDS operates in two main modes: signature-\\r\\nbased and anomaly-based detection. • Signature-Based Detection: This approach involves comparing observed activities against a \\r\\ndatabase of known attack signatures or patterns. If a match is found, the IDS raises an alert. Signature-based detection is effective against known threats but may struggle with new or \\r\\nsophisticated attacks that lack predefined signatures. • Anomaly-Based Detection: Anomaly-based IDS focuses on defining a baseline of normal network \\r\\nbehavior and alerting on deviations from that baseline. This method is more adept at detecting \\r\\nnovel or previously unseen attacks but may generate false positives if the baseline is not accurately \\r\\ncalibrated. IDS can be network-based, monitoring network traffic, or host-based, inspecting activities on individual \\r\\ndevices. Deployment of IDS contributes to early threat detection, aiding security teams in investigating and \\r\\nresponding to potential incidents promptly.

An IPS operates inline with network traffic and can take immediate action \\r\\nto thwart potential threats. It combines the detection mechanisms of IDS with the ability to enforce security \\r\\npolicies and respond in real-time. • Signature-Based Prevention: Similar to IDS, IPS utilizes signature-based detection to identify \\r\\nknown threats and employs predefined rules to block or allow traffic accordingly.

Security analysts can review historical endpoint data, track the progression \\r\\nof an incident, and understand the scope and impact. Additionally, EDR allows for response \\r\\nactions, such as isolating an infected endpoint or blocking malicious processes. • Endpoint Isolation: EDR solutions can isolate compromised endpoints to prevent the lateral \\r\\nmovement of threats within a network. This containment capability helps minimize the potential \\r\\nimpact of an attack by restricting the compromised system's communication with other network \\r\\nresources. • Forensic Analysis: EDR tools often include forensic capabilities, enabling security teams to \\r\\nconduct in-depth analyses of security incidents.

ANTIMALWARE SOLUTIONS \\r\\n \\r\\nAntimalware solutions, also known as antivirus, are essential components of cybersecurity designed to \\r\\ndetect, prevent, and remove malicious software, commonly referred to as malware. Malware encompasses a \\r\\nwide range of harmful software, including viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, adware, ransomware, and other \\r\\ntypes of malicious code. Antimalware solutions play a crucial role in protecting computer systems and \\r\\nnetworks from these threats. Key Features and Functionalities of Antimalware Solutions: \\r\\n \\r\\n• Signature-Based Detection: Traditional antimalware solutions often use signature-based detection. They maintain a database of known malware signatures, which are unique characteristics or \\r\\npatterns associated with specific malicious programs. When scanning files or processes, the \\r\\nsoftware compares them to these signatures to identify and quarantine known threats. • Heuristic Analysis: In addition to signature-based detection, many antimalware solutions use \\r\\nheuristic analysis to identify potential threats based on behavior or characteristics that may indicate \\r\\nmalicious intent. This allows the software to detect and respond to new or previously unknown \\r\\nmalware by recognizing suspicious patterns. • Behavioral Monitoring: Antimalware solutions monitor the behavior of programs and processes in \\r\\nreal-time. If a program behaves in a way consistent with malware (e.g., attempting to modify \\r\\ncritical system files or accessing sensitive data), the antimalware software can take action to \\r\\nprevent further malicious activity. • Real-Time Protection: Antimalware solutions provide real-time protection by actively scanning \\r\\nfiles, downloads, and system activities as they occur. This proactive approach helps prevent \\r\\nmalware from executing and causing harm before it can compromise the system.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"W0/gsOk57LoS2KOiP6mP6tfMxn/RoGcj7Bx7WQV8QTU=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"21a74796-cc17-46b1-ad36-693ef084b255":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"21a74796-cc17-46b1-ad36-693ef084b255\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":25,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf_25\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":25,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5KCxoyawISweXdmo3tGFZgzmDxigCmGUwOsmDCQYDlQ=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"14036fc7-a992-4368-a9d7-7b8231986744\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":25,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"W0/gsOk57LoS2KOiP6mP6tfMxn/RoGcj7Bx7WQV8QTU=\"}},\"text\":\"This proactive approach helps prevent \\r\\nmalware from executing and causing harm before it can compromise the system. • Automatic Updates: To stay effective against new and evolving threats, antimalware solutions \\r\\nregularly receive updates to their databases of malware signatures and heuristic algorithms.

A Security Operations Center (SOC) monitors a company’s digi-\\r\\ntal infrastructure to protect against these threats by detecting suspicious events and\\r\\ntaking mitigating action. Adversaries commonly need to access resources illegiti-\\r\\nmately to achieve action upon their objectives, and do so via existing user accounts. We develop a method to identify suspicious access behaviour using non-intrusive\\r\\ndata available to a SOC. For every user, a feature vector is constructed describing\\r\\ntheir access behaviour. This vector contains statistics over a predefined period of\\r\\ntime onwhat resourcesa user accessed atwhat timeand inwhat manner. We sur-\\r\\nvey different Machine Learning profiling possibilities and select the general-purpose\\r\\nK-means clustering to group users with similar behavioural characteristics. We apply this method to the Insider Threat logs from the Carnegie Mellon Uni-\\r\\nversity Software Engineering Institute, a synthetic dataset which is a benchmark for\\r\\ninsider threat detection research. Through access behaviour profiling, we were able\\r\\nto identify all users with the ITAdmin role. The consistency of clusters for benign\\r\\nusers over time was compared and quantified through the Adjusted Rand metric. Comparing consecutive months,  this resulted in an average consistency score of\\r\\n0.87. We were able to detect 80% of insider threats with the ITAdmin role by moni-\\r\\ntoring for changes in their cluster over time. Applying the same methodology to access data of real-world organisations al-\\r\\nlows for significantly less consistent clustering, with average consecutive month con-\\r\\nsistency scores of 0.41. We observe a slight similarity between our clusters and the\\r\\ngroupings within the organisation’s Active Directory. The clusters also show slight\\r\\nsimilarity with the groups inferred by Microsoft User Entity Behaviour and Analytics\\r\\nvia Machine Learning. We show how the granularity of the most relevant features\\r\\nof the synthetic dataset differs from that of real-world data, which is suspected to\\r\\ncause this decrease in clustering consistency. To  be  able  to  detect  suspicious  changes  in  user  access  behaviour  a  consis-\\r\\ntent profiling method is required. Our privacy-preserving, general-purpose profiling\\r\\nmethodology enabled consistent results on the synthetic dataset. However, we have\\r\\nstrong indication that in a production environment this data alone is not able to

organisations, and using account privi-\\r\\nleges to access digital resources illegitimately is a part of almost every successful\\r\\ncyber attack. This research creates a method to profile users based on their access\\r\\nbehaviour using the data from a Security Operations Center (SOC). Having accu-\\r\\nrate user access profiles allows for detecting suspicious deviations in this behaviour,\\r\\nwhich  can  be  used  to  alert  a  SOC  analyst  to  take  a  closer  look  at  an  account’s\\r\\nactivity and determine whether the accesses could be malicious. One of the good practices regarding cyber security is the least privilege principle. If a user does not need to access a particular resource for their regular responsibil-\\r\\nities, their account should not have access to this resource. This is an example of\\r\\naccess control, which takes effort to keep track of and maintain over time. For exam-\\r\\nple, if someone leaves a the company, their accesses should be revoked. In reality,\\r\\nthis is often not done correctly [1], causing accounts to have more privileges than\\r\\nrequired. This becomes a problem when an adversary manages to gain control of\\r\\nthis account, known as account compromise, or when a user turns against their em-\\r\\nployer, called an insider threat. If a domain admin account gets compromised with\\r\\nall the access rights they possess, it will pose a security risk even when adhering\\r\\nto the least privilege principle. Therefore it is crucial to not only survey the access\\r\\ncontrol policies but also consider the actual accesses an account performs to detect\\r\\nsuspicious activity, which is where a SOC comes into play. The goal of a SOC is to detect suspicious events within an organisation’s digital\\r\\ninfrastructure. Multiple data sources can be used for detection,  such as sensors\\r\\nwithin the network to capture traffic, logs of servers and logs of end-point devices. A\\r\\nSecurity Information and Event Management system (SIEM) is used to combine and\\r\\ncorrelate this data. Using this SIEM, a SOC looks for suspicious events such as an\\r\\naccount being granted admin privileges or a user visiting a possible phishing web-\\r\\nsite. Not every detection implies a security risk. Actions labelled as suspicious can\\r\\nhave been performed legitimately, or the detection rule can be faulty.

INTRODUCTION\\r\\ndetection causes manual labour for an analyst to verify the detection’s legitimacy, it\\r\\nis a SOC’s goal to finetune its detection rules. The detections should trigger on as\\r\\nmany security risks as possible, this is called a True Positive. The other possibilities\\r\\ninclude events without actual risk, called False Positives, from which we want as few\\r\\nas possible. Additionally, the rate of actual security threats going undetected, called\\r\\nFalse Negatives, should naturally be as close to zero as possible. The digital infrastructure of an organisation usually contains ‘crown jewels’, which\\r\\nare  their  most  valuable  assets. These  can  be  on-premise  servers  such  as  file\\r\\nservers, Domain Controllers (DCs) and mail exchange servers. DCs host a domain’s\\r\\nActive Directory (AD), which imposes user and device policies. A compromise of the\\r\\nDC can lead to malicious policies being executed on all of an organisation’s domain-\\r\\njoined devices, such as employee laptops. A file server usually contains much of\\r\\nan organisation’s confidential data, which should only be accessed by those with a\\r\\nlegitimate reason. Because we use access as an indicator for potentially malicious\\r\\nbehaviour,  these resource types are our main points of focus. The input data in\\r\\nthis research is limited to access events within the Windows Event log to remain\\r\\nas little invasive on user’s behavioural data as possible, whilst being able to make\\r\\ninferences on suspicious accounts. When behavioural monitoring raises an alert\\r\\nfor the SOC, the alert needs to clarifywhya certain user account was marked as\\r\\nsuspicious to assist the analyst in their further investigation. This reasoning is also\\r\\na requirement from ethical perspective,  as it is impermissible to have an opaque\\r\\nalgorithm labelling users for suspicion. This process needs to be as transparent and\\r\\nexplainable as possible. Detection rules within a SIEM describe when to raise an alert, based on log en-\\r\\ntries. An alert is a suspicious activity that a SOC analyst looks into to determine\\r\\nits legitimacy and takes action upon if it is suspected to be malicious. Frequently,\\r\\nsuch rules are static in determining suspicious events. However, this poses a prob-\\r\\nlem when creating a profile based on behaviour, as this is a dynamic characteristic.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"146HEakDpUNbq34HkCpxByYXfbPlPdKqGF3wHbthHl8=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"dd4aa975-29f3-414a-bb2b-344fe54bbd94":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"dd4aa975-29f3-414a-bb2b-344fe54bbd94\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":8,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_8\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":8,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"2EBwuCLaMB0nE/0xv2CwMUWsxU7wcCDOYWgRaWa9fFQ=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"77aba3ef-d118-4c7c-88de-b3ecfc35ef12\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":8,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"146HEakDpUNbq34HkCpxByYXfbPlPdKqGF3wHbthHl8=\"}},\"text\":\"Therefore, this research aims to develop a novel methodology using existing meth-\\r\\nods to create user behavioural profiles from access logs and be able to detect sus-\\r\\npicious deviations from this profile over time, by using non-invasive data available to\\r\\na SOC.

First,  we\\r\\ndescribe the data available to a SOC which can be used to reach our objective. Second,  the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) processes and\\r\\npossibilities are explained. Finally, we highlight the Data Science fundamentals re-\\r\\nquired to understand the methodology of this research. 2.1    SOC Access Data\\r\\nA SOC has several methods of monitoring digital infrastructure. By inserting sen-\\r\\nsors  into  the  network,  traffic  can  be  captured  to  detect  which  hosts  interact  with\\r\\neach other and possibly inspect the payload. Server logs are very useful, as these\\r\\nare central parts of the infrastructure with which many users directly or indirectly\\r\\ninteract. Organisations generally use a domain to manage their devices. A domain\\r\\nis a group of computers within a network administered by a central server, the Do-\\r\\nmain Controller (DC). Accounts within the domain can log onto every device they are\\r\\nauthorised to, using their domain account and password. Domain accounts authen-\\r\\nticate against the DC to log onto such devices and resources. There are multiple\\r\\ntypes of authentication, which are some of the events the SOC can monitor to de-\\r\\ntermine a user’s access behaviour. In addition to servers and networks, endpoint\\r\\ndevices such as employee laptops or phones can be monitored, as these types of\\r\\ndevices can provide access to company resources. Each of the above-mentioned devices generates logs. To correlate these different\\r\\ndata sources and analyse them, logs are sent to a Security Information and Event\\r\\nManagement (SIEM) system.

BACKGROUND\\r\\nsend a subset of their Windows Events logs2  3to this SIEM for analysis. To access a resource, a user must first authenticate to prove they are authorised. In the Windows domain this is commonly performed via the default protocol Kerberos\\r\\n[3], which uses tickets distributed by the DC, or the fall-back NTLM4, a challenge-\\r\\nresponse mechanism. When a user accesses a resource after valid authentication,\\r\\nWindows Event 4624 is logged:An account was successfully logged on. This event\\r\\ncontains, amongst others, information on the time, user, target host, authentication\\r\\ntype, connection method and source IP. If a user logs off, this generates events 4634\\r\\nor 4647, which include similar information. 2.2    Microsoft Sentinel\\r\\nThe  real-world  data  part  of  this  research  is  performed  using  the  Microsoft  Sen-\\r\\ntinel SIEM5. Sentinel is a cloud solution that,  among others,  can be used to in-\\r\\ngest logs from endpoint devices. The data is saved in tables and queried using\\r\\nthe Kusto  Query Language (KQL). The tables  used for this  research include the\\r\\nSecurityEventtable, which contains the ingested Windows Events. Azure Active\\r\\nDirectory (AAD) is an identity and access management tool organisations can use\\r\\nto sign into apps using Single Sign-On (SSO). Suppose the on-premise AD is syn-\\r\\nchronised with the Azure Active Directory. In that case, it is possible to correlate\\r\\nthe on-premise accounts with cloud accounts and perform further analyses using\\r\\nUser and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA)6.

The way we\\r\\napply these methods are further discussed in the methodology section. K-means clustering\\r\\nThis  section  describes  the  clustering  approach,  a  choice  which  is  further  moti-\\r\\nvated in Section 3.5. There are different possibilities for clustering points in a multi-\\r\\ndimensional area. In our case of user clustering, every point represents a user and\\r\\na  feature  vector  is  a  list  of  numerical  properties  describing  the  user’s  behaviour. Every feature within a user’s feature vector is translated to a dimension within the\\r\\nmultidimensional area. K-Means aims to partition objects in this multi-dimensional\\r\\nspace intonclusters. This is achieved by minimising the ’Within-Cluster Sum of\\r\\nSquares’ and maximising the ’Between-Cluster Sum of Squares’.The naive version\\r\\nof the algorithm uses the following steps, which are further illustrated by Figure 2.2:\\r\\n•Step 1:Initialisationselectnrandom points in multi-dimensional space to be\\r\\nthe initial ’centroid’\\r\\n•Step 2:InitialisationAssociate each point to its closest ’centroid’\\r\\n•Step 3:Compute the gravitational centre, the centroid, for each label\\r\\n•Step 4:Associate each point with their closest centroid\\r\\n•Step 5:Repeat from step 3 until convergence, or halt if the centroids do not\\r\\nmove anymore. The parameter provided to the K-Means clustering algorithm is the number of\\r\\nclusters, which influences every of the clustering steps. An extra centroid means\\r\\nthat the results of steps 3 and 4 of the algorithm will be different. Additionally, there is\\r\\na factor of chance in the algorithm. Picking the initial centroid points is performed at\\r\\nrandom, so selecting different points could cause the centroids to travel in a different\\r\\ndirection.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"RaMls9h5tghtCbGKC+r+wZdYlTaJ3AtPjq3Id6RUklo=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"e94bb5d4-197f-4253-9924-35fcf0fcf05f":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"e94bb5d4-197f-4253-9924-35fcf0fcf05f\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_13\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"BfJWzk3TLMfHiKj+IuQQV96gKbP+i1FeY/Em8t/tksM=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"5eb9fac1-e51f-48a2-a68e-ae317ca2ddfd\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"RaMls9h5tghtCbGKC+r+wZdYlTaJ3AtPjq3Id6RUklo=\"}},\"text\":\"Hence it is essential to reproducibility to seed the randomness so that,\\r\\ngiven the same data,  the algorithm will result in the same clusters when applied\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"qqspkOv+lqdSU9ZTqYOZFAzAe81PC4jYNTp6zrUynmI=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"8024f5d8-2d15-43ba-8aa6-f7d59204c14a":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"8024f5d8-2d15-43ba-8aa6-f7d59204c14a\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":14,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_14\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":14,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"uP2AmyXw4M77/r4k/pngudRtc7CygfDSE3SRghZmfGE=\"}},\"text\":\"8                                                                                                  CHAPTER2.

(Adjusted) Rand index\\r\\nA metric is required to measure how similar the clusters from different periods in time\\r\\nare. For this, we compare how users are divided amongst the clusters for different\\r\\niterations of the algorithm. This is not as trivial as counting the number of users\\r\\nclassified into different clusters, as the number of users designated to a cluster can\\r\\nchange. For  this,  we  apply  the  adjusted  Rand  index7,  a  function  measuring  the\\r\\nsimilarity of two separate cluster divisions. This metric was initially developed by\\r\\nRand [4], but because of the underlying formula, it often returns a value close to 1\\r\\nwhen comparing different sets of labels. The Rand index method was later optimised\\r\\nby Hubert et al. [5] to compensate for this factor of chance. We therefore apply the\\r\\nadjusted Rand score in this research. Quantify feature importance\\r\\nTo investigate what the most defining features are that caused a user to be classi-\\r\\nfied into a certain cluster, we apply the ’Unsupervised to Supervised’ method, using\\r\\nan external library8.

Finally, we visit the work benchmarking their anomaly detection algorithms on\\r\\nthe synthetic CERT Insider Threat dataset. 3.1    Access Control\\r\\nFor a user account to access a resource, they require the appropriate permissions. Within an organisation’s digital infrastructure, this is usually arranged via Active Di-\\r\\nrectory groups. A group can be granted read and write rights to a resource. If a user\\r\\nis a member of this group, they inherit all these rights. Managing such accesses\\r\\nfor users and groups is calledAccess control. The Principle of Least Privilege is\\r\\na concept within information security which describes that users should only have\\r\\naccess to the resources they need. Not adhering to this principle forms a security\\r\\nrisk if an adversary manages to control an account, such as in the case of account\\r\\ncompromise or insider threats. Research has tried to detect misconfigurations in such policies using different\\r\\napproaches. Das et al. [6] created Baaz: a tool that represents access control poli-\\r\\ncies  as  a  matrix,  which  for  every  user  (column)  and  every  resource  (row)  states\\r\\nwhether access is granted. If a reference dataset exists on which resources every\\r\\nrole should be able to access,  users can be mapped to a role group with similar\\r\\nrights. The resources that share the same policies are clustered if no reference\\r\\nmatrix is available. From this, clusters of users with roughly the same access per-\\r\\nmissions can be produced. After the clustering step, users and resources which do\\r\\nnot fit into any cluster are marked as outliers. In this case,  anOutliercan imply\\r\\nusers with too many permissions, a security issue, and users who have too few per-\\r\\n11\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"j1WGKWmALGbiyDs2/37f4h2rFGhwbq0DWGqqYMvWA7c=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"50b77c70-475c-40a0-81e5-7d5eb5ec0ccd":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"50b77c70-475c-40a0-81e5-7d5eb5ec0ccd\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":18,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_18\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":18,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"DVEPW/ViTxabxJfyiDV+krxIGEGCo/SkcQs4VclMWUU=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"58dadd75-37c7-45b8-86f4-b303990dad79\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":18,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"arH9/SDAftfQTY227K+1nMRxN6OAVLsGn+Ru694CdFo=\"}},\"text\":\"12                                                                                             CHAPTER3. RELATEDWORK\\r\\nmissions, an accessibility issue. The detection of accessibility issues is, to us, not\\r\\na goal in itself, but repeated access requests through misconfigurations could lead\\r\\nto  administrators  becoming  too  generous  in  granting  access  permissions,  hence\\r\\nleading to security issues again. In reality,  such well-documented access control\\r\\nmatrices or even a reference dataset on roles and resources are often not available. Therefore is more realistic to perform analyses on logs. Bauer et al. [7] performed\\r\\nlog analysis to analyse the access attempts foraccessibilityproblems. They used\\r\\nassociation rule mining [8], a type of inference that tries to predict future accesses\\r\\nthrough previous ones. Because such rules can repeatedly produce the same false\\r\\nassociation, a feedback mechanism was introduced to prevent these mistakes from\\r\\nreoccurring. However, since such labelling is performed manually, when applied on\\r\\na larger scale it becomes labour-intensive, which is undesirable to a SOC. 3.2    Relational database user profiling through access\\r\\nlogs\\r\\nOne of the goals of profiling users through access logs is to detect deviations from\\r\\nthe norm. This is a use case foranomaly detection, for example, when someone\\r\\nsuddenly changes behaviour to access more resources than usual or logs in outside\\r\\nof office hours. The research area of user profiling and anomaly detection using logs is more\\r\\nmature within the field of relational databases. Even though this is a specific type\\r\\nof resource access, their methodologies are still relevant when considering broader\\r\\nresource types. Kamra et al. [9] mined SQL queries from the database audit logs,\\r\\ncreating profiles to model normal database access behaviour. These profiles consist\\r\\nofquiplets, extracting different fields from the SQL query to determine what data is\\r\\nqueried, such as tables, columns and constraints. To train their model, outliers were\\r\\nremoved,  under the assumption that the leftover queries were benign. Similar to\\r\\nBauer [7], they used two scenarios:  role-based and unsupervised. For the former,\\r\\nthe role was available for every user executing query, and the Naive Bayes Clas-\\r\\nsifier1was used to produce the probability that a user with this role would indeed\\r\\nexecute such a query. The unsupervised scenario is approached as a clustering\\r\\nproblem.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"OsCZcbcwEq+ArchCXv7egRxebHY4hl7CxSGG3oF5B0A=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"58dadd75-37c7-45b8-86f4-b303990dad79":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"58dadd75-37c7-45b8-86f4-b303990dad79\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":18,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_18\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":18,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"DVEPW/ViTxabxJfyiDV+krxIGEGCo/SkcQs4VclMWUU=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"50b77c70-475c-40a0-81e5-7d5eb5ec0ccd\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":18,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"OsCZcbcwEq+ArchCXv7egRxebHY4hl7CxSGG3oF5B0A=\"}},\"text\":\"The unsupervised scenario is approached as a clustering\\r\\nproblem.

Another\\r\\nexample is the shortest path between two URLs:  how many hyperlinks it takes to\\r\\nget from one internet page to the other. The core of this detection mechanism is that\\r\\nthere needs to be a numerical distance to express similarity between two accesses,\\r\\nwhich is hard to apply within our access type without significant domain knowledge\\r\\nof the network and occupations.

These\\r\\nactions are kept track of within both static time windows and user sessions to com-\\r\\npare performance. They used the CERT v4.2 dataset to benchmark their approach. Sharma recognises that it is harder to find a trade-off between false positives and\\r\\nmissing anomalies when using fixed time windows to extract features. It is hard to\\r\\ndetect an anomaly for short windows, whilst for large windows, the behaviour could\\r\\nbecome too generic. Therefore, the model takes all events within one session as\\r\\nfeature vector input, which comprises 44 features. These events include numerical\\r\\nfeatures such as to how many devices a connection was made or how many job\\r\\nsearching websites were visited and categorical features such as the role or func-\\r\\ntional unit. All numbers are normalised to a range of (0,1). Sharma et al. found that\\r\\noff-hour activity is critical information, just as whether usage is from a user’s regular\\r\\npc. Their feature vectors are chronologically divided into training, validation and test-\\r\\ning. Unsupervised LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks [20] are used to prepare the\\r\\nmodel as this allows for temporal analysis when one action depends on the other. In this LSTM network, the session is anomalous if a reconstruction error is larger\\r\\nthan the threshold computer during the learning phase.

RELATEDWORK\\r\\nAs the CERT dataset includes different malicious scenarios, Le also tested which\\r\\napproaches work best for what type of scenario. They performed classification of\\r\\nboth instances (one log entry or feature vector) and users (whether an employee\\r\\nturned malicious at some point). From these two, the user-based detection resulted\\r\\nin  the  highest  precision  rates. Additionally,  for  the  RF  classifier,  they  performed\\r\\nfeature analysis based on Gini impurity. This is used to infer how important every\\r\\nfeature within the vector is for the ML algorithm. Realising this effectivity per type\\r\\nof threat scenario and the importance of different features is very useful to realise\\r\\nwhat input data is relevant and what types of threats still go undetected. After ap-\\r\\nplying supervised ML approaches,  the same authors performed an unsupervised\\r\\nlearning-based anomaly detection approach for insider threat detection [23]. They\\r\\napplied four methods: Auto-encoders, Isolation Forest, Lightweight On-line detection\\r\\nof anomalies, and Local Outlier Factor. Additionally, they varied the representation\\r\\nof temporal information within data, optimising how behavioural changes over time\\r\\nare detected. Variations include concatenating feature vectors from a specific time-\\r\\nframe, explicitly adding the percentile, or the difference between a number and its\\r\\nmean or median, to the feature vector. Every CERT version dataset has a differ-\\r\\nent organisational structure and scenarios. They looked into their model’s generic\\r\\napplicability and robustness for different datasets by training on one CERT dataset\\r\\nversion and applying it to another. Finally, applying multiple algorithms allows vot-\\r\\ning:  An event is only marked as anomalous if the number of algorithms marking it\\r\\nanomalous crosses a threshold.

Therefore we decided to\\r\\nuse the general-purpose, straightforward K-means clustering algorithm, which solely\\r\\nrequires the desired amount of clusters as input parameters, which can be gener-\\r\\nated using the Elbow heuristic. The main drawback of this algorithm is that it does\\r\\nnot perform very well on clusters of different sizes. This could, in future research, be\\r\\nsolved by profiling the feature vectors before clustering and selecting the clustering\\r\\napproach based on this, but discovering the perfect clustering algorithm falls outside\\r\\nof the scope of this research. Access log data used\\r\\nThere are multiple stages where it is possible to monitor user access behaviour. During authentication via Kerberos,  when a user authenticates against the DC a\\r\\nWindows Event describes what type of service a TGS (Ticket Granting Server) had\\r\\nbeen requested for. Then a user logs onto the host and performs actions on this\\r\\ndevice. Our goal is to detect it when a user suspiciously changes access behaviour\\r\\nfrom their regular profile. We want this detection to be as generally applicable as\\r\\npossible. Logged authentication events are hard to correlate because TGSs are\\r\\ncommonly not sent to the SIEM and authentication tokens are valid for en extended\\r\\nperiod of time, making monitoring difficult for, e.g. outside office hour activity. We\\r\\nalso need to decide which devices we can use the logs from. Logs from endpoint de-\\r\\nvices such as employee laptops generate many events. Since there are many such\\r\\ndevices, a SIEM would be flooded with data if they were all onboarded to the SIEM. Therefore, these endpoint devices are commonly not onboarded, making them hard\\r\\nto monitor. As previously mentioned, servers are among the most valuable assets\\r\\nwithin an organisation, so we will limit our monitoring to those servers. Additionally,\\r\\nmany employee devices will need to connect to such servers to access domain-\\r\\nwide resources. Therefore we limit our focus to the actual logon event (4624) onto\\r\\nservers,  as this allows us to observewhich accountconnected towhich hostat\\r\\nwhich timeandhow.

METHODOLOGY\\r\\naccess behaviour change. A SOC analyst would take a closer look at the histori-\\r\\ncal behaviour of the user and gather contextual data to determine whether the be-\\r\\nhaviour is potentially malicious. If too many users change clusters two problems\\r\\narise when comparing different time periods. First, as a SOC analyst looks at all\\r\\nusers changing behaviour to determine its legitimacy, more users being marked as\\r\\nhaving suspicious behaviour leads to an increase in manual workload. Second, if\\r\\nusers change behaviour this will affect the location of their cluster’s centroid. The\\r\\ndynamic element of changing human behaviour is part of the reason why we ex-\\r\\npected ML to be more suitable for suspicious change detection rather than static\\r\\nthresholds. However, if many users change behaviour and thereby possible switch\\r\\nclusters, this affects the locations of all centroids. Then, it is not trivial anymore to\\r\\ndetermine which centroid’s cluster belonged to which group of users. Determining\\r\\nthis is necessary to detect which users changed behaviour more than the rest of\\r\\ntheir cluster. Therefore, this approach would only work if the number of distinguish-\\r\\nable user groups stays the same, and that the majority of the users stay in their own\\r\\ncluster over time. Huge behavioural shifts could be avoided by using smaller time\\r\\nperiods, however this increases the dataset skew as relative changes have a greater\\r\\ninfluence so might work counterproductive. We go further into this in Section 6.3. 4.2    Sentinel\\r\\nFor the analysis within Sentinel the analysis methodology is comparable to CERT’s\\r\\nSection 4.1, only the data types and performance quantification possibilities are dif-\\r\\nferent. Section 2.2 elaborates further on the functioning of Sentinel, including the\\r\\ndata and analysis possibilities. The analysis is performed within a Sentinel Note-\\r\\nbook, which is a Jupyter Notebook whose kernel runs on an Azure virtual machine.

This equalises the importance of all individual fea-\\r\\ntures, as they all have the same range, limiting the influence of outliers. The relative\\r\\ndifference between a feature’s value between different users stays the same. Another method of standardisation is achieved through QuantileTransformers11. This\\r\\nmethod  transforms  the  feature  values  to  follow  a  uniform  or  normal  distribution. Through this, the relative distance to outliers are reduced which limits their impact. Additionally,  values which are close together are spread out through this type of\\r\\ntransformation. Different clustering method\\r\\nAs the K-means clustering approach simply classifies the users closest to a centroid\\r\\ninto one cluster, this could blur the boundaries between clusters and is heavily in-\\r\\nfluenced by the randomised initial position of the centroids. In addition, it does not\\r\\nrecognise clusters of different sizes well, whereas we could expect organisations to\\r\\nnot have evenly distributed groups of users with similar access behaviour. There-\\r\\nfore, we apply the DBSCAN clustering approach12to get an indication whether this\\r\\ncould outperform K-means clustering with regards to clustering consistency or com-\\r\\nparison to peers and AD groups. DBSCAN clustering recognises densely populated\\r\\nareas in a multidimensional space and groups the users within such areas together\\r\\nin a cluster. If an area is not densely populated, then the users within this area are\\r\\nnot put into a cluster at all. A single parameter is required for this function: theep-\\r\\nsilon. This parameter describes the maximum distance between two points for them\\r\\nto be considered in each others neighbourhood. A higher epsilon value will lead to\\r\\nless dense points being included in the cluster. Longer period of time for feature vector creation\\r\\nWhilst requiring significantly more resources in computing power and time, the data\\r\\nof multiple weeks could be aggregated together to take the data of an entire month\\r\\ninto account when creating the feature vectors. This reduces the influence that minor\\r\\nbehavioural changes such as a vacation day or tasks which are not executed on a\\r\\nweekly basis could have on the clustering classification.

RESULTS\\r\\nthis cannot be used to group users based on the resources they access. The cumu-\\r\\nlative difference from the mean feature was not used for clustering because of the\\r\\nskew it has dependant on the first day of the dataset. The access amount on the first\\r\\nday of the dataset sets the mean, and it takes a while for this skew to average out\\r\\nand for the mean number of daily accesses to reach an equilibrium. It also did not\\r\\ncontribute to identifying the users labelled insiders. This is most likely since the ma-\\r\\nlicious actions in the CERT dataset are not preceded by share discovery or lateral\\r\\nmovement. Because of this arbitrariness, and the unexplainability on its influence in\\r\\ngenerating logical clusters, we did not include this deviation feature in the clustering.

RESULTS\\r\\nApplying the same methodology using K=2 to other months resulted in the same\\r\\noutcome: ITAdmins and non-ITAdmins are consistently classified in a separate clus-\\r\\nter. There are some exceptions, which are highlighted at the end of this section. The\\r\\nscree plot returns that all the variance can be shown using solely PC (Principal Com-\\r\\nponent) 1, which is also visible in Figure 5.3, as the PC1 axis alone separates the\\r\\ntwo user groups. PC 1 is constructed through a combination of almost all features,\\r\\nthe division of which is shown in Figure 5.4. Figure 5.4:Heatmap on how much every feature is used to display the two Principal\\r\\nComponents for the CERT dataset period 2010-04-01 until 2020-05-01. Feature importancesWe can look at what features caused the ITAdmins to be\\r\\nclassified in a different cluster than all other roles via the Feature Importance metrics. There are just two clusters, so the feature importances for cluster 0 are identical to\\r\\nthe feature importances for cluster 1, since the most influential feature causing a\\r\\nuser to be classified into cluster 0 is also the most influental feature causing a user\\r\\nto notbe classified into cluster 1. Figure 5.5 shows that the most influential features\\r\\nare the average number of daily accesses, the median session length and the total\\r\\nnumber of logons. The features differentiating the least between admins and other\\r\\nusers are the weekends logon,  the percentage thereof,  and the number of office\\r\\nhour accesses. Now that we know the feature importances we can look at the feature statistics\\r\\nof the clusters,  compare it with feature statistics on roles,  and verify whether the\\r\\nclustering is explainable.

SENTINEL49\\r\\n5.2    Sentinel\\r\\nThis  part  of  the  research  was  conducted  in  the  Microsoft  Azure  Machine  Learn-\\r\\ning  Studio1,  a  cloud  Jupyter  notebook. We  perform  this  analysis  in  the  Sentinel\\r\\nenvironment using Northwave SOC customer data.Note:  Because this concerns\\r\\nprivacy-sensitive data, any information on user accounts and infrastructure has been\\r\\nanonymised. Preprocessing steps\\r\\nWithin Sentinel Notebook, the results of executing a query are saved in a dataframe. This process has a limit of 500.000 rows, which poses a problem when processing\\r\\ndata for larger organisations as they generate too many logon- and logoff Windows\\r\\nevents. This is because one user action is not necessarily correlated with one logon\\r\\nevent. Under the hood Windows can keep connecting and disconnecting to for ex-\\r\\nample a remote file server, causing a lot of events. This can lead to over 500.000\\r\\nevents on a single day alone. Therefore we reduce the granularity of the access\\r\\ntimes,  by summarizing all accesses with the same properties into one event per\\r\\nhour2. This reduces the data more than tenfold. Still, with this reduce of granularity\\r\\nthe largest timespan which can be queried at once is a week, instead of a month\\r\\nlike for the CERT dataset. In addition to removing accounts based on SID and account name, we attempted\\r\\nto cluster the dataset and removed outlier users which were placed in a cluster on\\r\\ntheir own. The purpose of this is to improve the clustering granularity for the rest of\\r\\nthe user-base. These accounts are consistently outliers amongst different weeks. It could not always be infered by the account name or description that they were\\r\\nautomated, so in reality would be worth an investigation from an analyst to identify\\r\\nwhy their access behaviour differs so significantly from the rest.

CLUSTERING CONSISTENCY IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS57\\r\\n5.3    Clustering consistency improvement efforts\\r\\nThis section lists the different efforts put into increasing the clustering consistency\\r\\nand similarity to UserPeerAnalytics and AD groups. In an attempt to improve the stability of the clusters, we aggregated data of mul-\\r\\ntiple weeks, circumvening the earlier query limit. This lead to a slight improvement\\r\\nin clustering stability score, as seen in Figure 5.19, but is still far from a stable clus-\\r\\ntering. Additionally, the comparison to AD groups score increased to an average of\\r\\n0.47 amongst users, and the average UserPeer score increased to 0.30. Figure 5.19:Cluster similarity score in production data through comparing different\\r\\nmonths. We tested a variety of input feature compositions, such as including matching\\r\\nthe CERT dataset features, or only incorporating destination hosts as features, but\\r\\nthese only decreased the consistency scores. Of the different logontypes, the net-\\r\\nwork logon was observed most. This is because of the way Windows operates in\\r\\nthe background when connecting to another device,  as explained in Section 4.2. Therefore, not every access logged correlates to a user interaction. To try and more\\r\\nclosely match the CERT dataset’s structure, we filtered on the LogonType 10: RDP\\r\\n(Remote Desktop). With this type of logon, one user action does correlate to a single\\r\\nlogon event. In addition, there are significantly fewer events hence we could incor-\\r\\nporate the data of an entire month and include the session duration feature. RDP is\\r\\nalso often used by threat actors to use a compromised account for lateral movement. Therefore this behaviour could visibly change compared to a user’s regular actions. Unfortunately, filtering on RDP only decreased the cluster stability when comparing\\r\\nconsecutive months, as shown in Figure 5.20.

DISCUSSION ANDRECOMMENDEDRESEARCHDIRECTIONS\\r\\nITAdmins versus other users\\r\\nOur clustering approach can separate users with the ITAdmin role from regular users\\r\\nwith ease. The main defining features for this were the average daily accesses and\\r\\nsession length, as Appendix A.1 reveals that ITAdmins perform more and shorter\\r\\nsessions. This is an inference that we could not have gotten by reading the dataset\\r\\ndescription, which only decribes ITAdmins having global access privileges. As shown in Table 5.1, our clustering approach works well in detecting admin insid-\\r\\ners as they switch clusters in the period of their insider actions. Investigation of the logon actions of ITAdmin users revealed that they perform no\\r\\nfurther accesses soon after their last insider actions are performed. This decreases\\r\\nthe ITAdmin’s number of accesses for the month they performed malicious actions\\r\\nin, which skews their behaviour from an ITAdmin user to a regular user. Within the\\r\\nscenario where the CERT Insider Threat dataset is created this implies that after\\r\\nsomeone  has  performed  their  malicious  actions  they  leave  the  company  straight\\r\\naway. This type of detection limits itself to a certain type of insider, and could also\\r\\ntrigger when a user is less productive than regular. The latter is not a security risk\\r\\nand quite invasive,  and would be regarded as a False Positive for our algorithm. Therefore, in this case, our algorithm does not detect a suspicious change in be-\\r\\nhaviour through a user accessingmoreresources than usual, but by a user access-\\r\\ninglessresources than usual. This has overlap with the research topic of Quitting\\r\\nDetection. Quitting detection is a subject within Insider Threat detection research\\r\\nwhich focuses on predicting that a user will turn against their employer. This is used\\r\\nin the insider threat detection research by Gavai et al. [24], who use quitting detec-\\r\\ntion as a proxy for insider threat detection. Therefore, our clustering approach works\\r\\nwell in quitting detection for ITAdmins, but only after the user has actually quit. 6.2    Real-world production environment clustering\\r\\nObservations\\r\\nDue to the problems with query limits as described in Section 5.2, we performed\\r\\nthe majority of the clustering using one week of data.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"hKSlyaSMGCkV8Wkhco5xhlzSbU/yDXv4nBTmCHF6ISE=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"fefbd5b4-4384-4715-9c4c-dee7dffe2ca8":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"fefbd5b4-4384-4715-9c4c-dee7dffe2ca8\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":68,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_68\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":68,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"gqt72UAnIeoKAkM43QWSWeVBX8XVb1dDmbKQWxWetqE=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"9072a0a1-1e12-4d3c-af7d-d64bcf398b17\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":68,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"hKSlyaSMGCkV8Wkhco5xhlzSbU/yDXv4nBTmCHF6ISE=\"}},\"text\":\"Since this is relatively short,\\r\\nthe feature vector values are unlikely to converge (yet) for every user, as the mean,\\r\\nmedian and standard deviation shift with every added day of data.

This could point to a misconfiguration, however deeper analysis of the situation re-\\r\\nquires domain knowledge of the organisation as well as their privilege and AD group\\r\\noverview. This type of analysis is closer to the Baaz [6] tool, and would not require\\r\\naccess data as input. There was one cluster with only a handful of members, where\\r\\nthe cluster average on the ’outside office hours accesses’ feature was significantly\\r\\nhigher than any other cluster.

As elaborated in the Methodology section,  one of the reasons we employ ML\\r\\nfor  our  feature  vectors  instead  of  static  thresholds  is  to  account  for  the  dynamic\\r\\nbehaviour users have. A user gets placed in a cluster relative to all other users.

DISCUSSION ANDRECOMMENDEDRESEARCHDIRECTIONS\\r\\nIf parts of our approach are used in the future, it is recommended to change the\\r\\nclustering algorithm. The element of randomness in K-means clustering can cause\\r\\nusers in bordering clusters to switch continuously over time. Additionally, the grav-\\r\\nitational centers (centroids) tend towards larger groups. Many people sharing the\\r\\nsame behaviour will therefore skew the rest of the groups. In our research, every re-\\r\\nsource had as much influence as any other as feature in the multidimensional area,\\r\\nwhilst in reality some resources could be more relevant for clustering than others. This can be done according to the resource importance, or type such as file server\\r\\nor domain controller. That way, it is likely that one of the clusters will contain users\\r\\naccessing the crown jewels amongst resources, which are likely to be administra-\\r\\ntors. Giving weight to resources enables detecting users suddenly connecting to\\r\\nvital infrastructure whereas usually they did not. Combining this with other proper-\\r\\nties of an access event, such as using RDP for the first time to connect to a DC1, is\\r\\nsignificant data when keeping track of an ’anomaly score’, such as our cumulative\\r\\ndifference from the mean number of accesses. This also requires mapping adver-\\r\\nsarial actions to potential indicators in the data, the RDP connection to a DC in the\\r\\nbeforementioned case. In addition to resources, of the weight of any feature could\\r\\nof course be increased relative to less important features. Whilst we had statistics\\r\\nper cluster on which resources were accessed most often, this did not enable us to\\r\\ndraw a picture on what type of users populated a cluster. As the resources them-\\r\\nselves were a significant feature for the clustering, classifying the resources could\\r\\nshow a ’bigger picture’ of what types of resources users access, providing a better\\r\\npicture of a cluster’s regular behaviour. Therefore, in future research we would also\\r\\nrecommend categorizing the resources and using the categories as features.

CONCLUSION\\r\\nbetween many user’s values, then small deviations can lead to significantly different\\r\\nclusterings. This is due to the the primitive method K-means works, combined with\\r\\nthe randomness of the initialisation phase. How  does  our  profiling  methodology  perform  within  the  CERT\\r\\nv4.2 synthetic dataset on consistency and extracting user groups? The profiling methodology creates a clear distinction between users with the ITAd-\\r\\nmin role and users without. The distinctive feature values of ITAdmins show that\\r\\nthey perform more accesses, have shorter session durations and more accesses\\r\\noutside of office hours compared to other users. Other than the ITAdmins, no clear\\r\\nrole distinction could be made. For the K=5 value the clusters are consistent with an\\r\\naverage adjusted Rand score of 0.87 for consecutive months. How does this profiling methodology translate to real-world data\\r\\nin terms of consistency and extracted user groups? For production data our features show less separation between the users, so slight\\r\\nbehavioural  changes  causes  users  to  switch  clusters  often. Additionally,  the  K-\\r\\nmeans initialisation phase is random so users close to bordering clusters can ran-\\r\\ndomly switch clusters. Increasing the timespan over which the features are created\\r\\nhas a slight positive effect on the consistency, but stays at an adjusted Rand score\\r\\nof 0.41 for consecutive periods. Hence,  the consistency does not come close to\\r\\nthe one achieved for the synthetic CERT dataset and cannot be used in practice for\\r\\nidentifying suspicious access behaviour. There is a mediocre similarity between our extracted clusters, AD groups and Mi-\\r\\ncrosoft UEBA’s UserPeerAnalytics. The scores for our custom performance metrics\\r\\ndo not come close to the hypothetical maximum of 1.0, but are consistently better\\r\\ncompared to users being classified into clusters at random. This implies there is a\\r\\nsignal in the data, but via our methodology does not lead to usable results. Is it possible to profile users consistently using explainable clus-\\r\\ntering and non-invasive data sources available to a Security Op-\\r\\nerations Center? We used logon events to create privacy-preserving feature vectors for every user,\\r\\nbased on literature research and threat intelligence.

This is likely due quitting after the malicious\\r\\nactions have taken place.

Through this methodology, it is not possible\\r\\nto determine deviating behaviour accurately using solely logon data. Profiling users\\r\\nconsistently using explainable clustering requires at least different pre-processing\\r\\nto bring more granularity to the available data.

More invasive data is likely required to differ between users, as was used by\\r\\nsimilar research to achieve higher insider threat and account compromise detection\\r\\nscores. To summarise, we converted non-invasive access logs into a feature vector per user. We applied K-means clustering to these feature vectors and compared the formed\\r\\nclusters with known user groups. We also compared clusters of different periods in\\r\\ntime to each other.

I. INTRODUCTION \\r\\nCybercriminals  often  focus  their  attention  on  healthcare \\r\\nproviders  and  related  institutions. The  continuum  of  care \\r\\nresults  in  a  landscape  that  is  convoluted  and  diverse  in  terms \\r\\nof the individuals, devices, apps, and procedures that comprise \\r\\nit. This landscape provides potential entry points for attackers \\r\\ninto  the network. A  further  tactic  that  attackers  might  use  to \\r\\ncarry out ransomware attacks is to threaten the interruption of \\r\\nessential  life-saving  utilities. The  culmination  of  all  these \\r\\nactions  produces  data  that  may  be  put  to  use  to  trace  down \\r\\nattackers and stop them in their path. Indicators of data breach \\r\\nmay  be  found  across  all  sectors,  but  healthcare  organizations \\r\\nwant   high-quality   data   that   is   tailored   to   their   operating \\r\\nconditions in order to cut down on the amount of time it takes \\r\\nto discover and react to threats. Due to the sensitive nature of \\r\\npatient  data,  the  healthcare  business  is  a  top  target  for  the \\r\\nperpetration   of   cyberattacks. It   is   possible   for   patients, \\r\\nhealthcare  professionals,  and  healthcare  organizations  to  face \\r\\nserious repercussions as a result of the theft, loss, or improper \\r\\nuse of sensitive information.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"SIyLl1b9DFFXRyowiJuqTpjwyydp3gZ5DV5cafAcRX0=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"05cd8d16-7781-481e-8b65-03fadd6f955c":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"05cd8d16-7781-481e-8b65-03fadd6f955c\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":1,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf_1\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":1,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"1MQ/QJk0mhcetHbPFq4LcCViKHmfYPTiSZytopH12hs=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"4b49b60a-e062-46a3-b3b9-4eef7d47928f\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":1,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"SIyLl1b9DFFXRyowiJuqTpjwyydp3gZ5DV5cafAcRX0=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"205cdc4d-57c4-422c-9286-39248bf05635\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":1,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"oi2jkmgEA3+TXaxg4L10yPQTiBZi4rRSa00YWmIYT+s=\"}},\"text\":\"As a result, it is essential to have \\r\\nan  efficient  cybersecurity  plan  in  order  to  safeguard  patient \\r\\ndata  and  stay  in  compliance  with  HIPAA  regulations.

The framework is developed using the design science research methodology and has been validated by generating \\r\\nfour novel metrics to assess the technical performance of a SOC. Additionally, the study examines the existing \\r\\nlandscape of metrics for SOCs and concludes that a majority of the metrics discussed in the literature primarily \\r\\nfocus on operational aspects rather than technical performance. The absence of adequate technical performance \\r\\nmetrics makes it challenging to accurately evaluate the tangible impact of a SOC on overall cyber defense \\r\\ncapabilities. The research also highlights the insufficiency of current methods in constructing metrics and \\r\\nframeworks tailored for measuring SOCs’ technical performance. The resulting framework offers SOCs means to \\r\\ncreate high-quality metrics for performance evaluation. Furthermore, the metrics the framework was validated \\r\\nwith offer SOCs an opportunity to enhance their ability to quantify their threat detection capabilities. 1. Introduction\\r\\nCyber threats have evolved dramatically over the last few years. They have become more sophisticated and complex, and as a result, \\r\\nthey have a greater impact on operational activities. The use of general-\\r\\npurpose malware has declined recently and more advanced threats, \\r\\nsuch as supply chain compromises, extortion activities, misinformation \\r\\ncampaigns, and business e-mail compromises, are continuously increas-\\r\\ning (European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, 2021).\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"f0vtVipSLRjTqSRLBJYiIOZNbMeU6F8FOTSFyU/ddTs=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"b0ea4e90-6b81-4698-a670-678198f5b4b2":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"b0ea4e90-6b81-4698-a670-678198f5b4b2\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":1,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_1\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":1,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"mfZBFWCDZq7p/b0JeRPIbR33iwHLFZUjDooaT/4dfI4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"0f229259-41ad-4ddc-80e0-77519f4075ca\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":1,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"f0vtVipSLRjTqSRLBJYiIOZNbMeU6F8FOTSFyU/ddTs=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"dd255960-3d5e-4cf6-bf9a-9163c77a5eb7\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":1,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"Cmq7hqveZaU+BVmMibXct6lEAob/c+PJxNXfhHpqo0o=\"}},\"text\":\"The increased \\r\\nsophistication and the associated risks require organizations to improve \\r\\ntheir defensive capabilities for combatting the evolving threat landscape \\r\\nbecause traditional malware and network defenses are not enough to \\r\\nprotect the organization from modern-day cyber threats. A strategy for organizations to increase their cyber defense capa-\\r\\nbilities is to acquire security operations center (SOC) capabilities. On \\r\\na general level, the SOC operations can be produced in-house, out-\\r\\nsourced to a managed service provider, or operated in a hybrid model in \\r\\nwhich the internal SOC is complemented by an external SOC provider. According to Nathans (2014), a SOC is typically responsible for detect-\\r\\ning security incidents and initiating related incident response activities. Nathans also determined that depending on the size and the needs of \\r\\nthe organization, the SOC can consist of a single person or a larger \\r\\nteam working in 24/7 shifts that together form a coherent collection \\r\\nof different competencies to prevent, detect, and resolve cyber threats. Furthermore, Vielberth et al. (2020)mentioned there are several ways \\r\\n* Corresponding author. E-mail addresses:joonas.forsberg@iki.fi(J.Forsberg), tapio.k.frantti@jyu.fi(T.Frantti). to operate and design SOCs, and that the outcome is influenced by var-\\r\\nious factors, such as regulations, company strategy, and expertise. To quantify the operational efficiency and capabilities of a SOC, \\r\\nperformance should be measured using a set of commonly agreed met-\\r\\nrics. A literature survey performed by Vielberth et al. (2020)concluded \\r\\nthat the currently established metrics are insufficient for measuring the \\r\\nperformance of the SOC. This viewpoint is supported by Kokulu et al. (2019), Agyepong et al. (2020)and Sundaramurthy et al. (2015). Multiple publications on SOCs focus primarily on quantitative vol-\\r\\nume and time-based operational and vulnerability-related metrics to \\r\\nmeasure the performance of SOCs (Nathans, 2014; Ahlm, 2021; Kokulu \\r\\net al., 2019). The operational metrics can help managers measure and \\r\\noptimize human resource utilization in analysis. Other quantitative met-\\r\\nrics, such as vulnerability-related data, can provide an overview of the \\r\\noverall exposure to known threats (Nathans, 2014).\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"KQJW9up+jJkbZqvdYDQ7AQEIepBGjrBzFN5nEoRn7iE=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"dd255960-3d5e-4cf6-bf9a-9163c77a5eb7":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"dd255960-3d5e-4cf6-bf9a-9163c77a5eb7\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":1,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_1\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":1,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"mfZBFWCDZq7p/b0JeRPIbR33iwHLFZUjDooaT/4dfI4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"b0ea4e90-6b81-4698-a670-678198f5b4b2\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":1,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"KQJW9up+jJkbZqvdYDQ7AQEIepBGjrBzFN5nEoRn7iE=\"}},\"text\":\"In practice, they \\r\\nare inefficient in measuring the capabilities of SOCs, because they can-\\r\\nnot measure the effectiveness of the detection capabilities and other \\r\\nprotective controls.

An argument could be made that an industry standard framework \\r\\nfor measuring SOCs does not exist at the moment. The lack of com-\\r\\nmonly accepted methods to measure the technical performance of a \\r\\nSOC is particularly prominent when the SOC is being outsourced to a \\r\\nthird-party vendor. This often leads to a situation where the tender-\\r\\ning process produces a suboptimal result, either by selecting the vendor \\r\\nwith the lowest total service cost or the most convincing sales mate-\\r\\nrial. In Finland, a trend has been observed, where vendors are chosen \\r\\non a proof of concept phase, in which an attack simulation is performed \\r\\nin an environment temporarily monitored by the vendor and afterward \\r\\ntheir threat detection capabilities are evaluated. The trend is essentially \\r\\na manifestation of the difficulty in evaluating the technical capabilities \\r\\nof different vendors. Although it can provide useful insights when com-\\r\\nparing vendors, the results are not truly comparable between vendors \\r\\nbecause the number of resources allocated to the proof of concept can \\r\\nsignificantly impact the final results and thus skew the vendor selection. The objective of this study was to determine the metrics and other per-\\r\\nformance indicators relevant for measuring the technical performance of a \\r\\nSOC. Without properly constructed metrics, it is difficult to evaluate \\r\\nhow substantial impact the SOC has on the overall cyber defense capa-\\r\\nbilities. A technical performance metric within this paper is defined as \\r\\na qualitative or quantitative indicator derived from one or more measure-\\r\\nments resulting from the activities performed by the SOC, which describes \\r\\nhow well the SOC can utilize technologies to prevent, identify, detect, and \\r\\nrespond to cyber threats affecting the organization.Compared to an opera-\\r\\ntional performance metric, a technical performance metric attempts to \\r\\nquantify the defensive capabilities, rather than assessing the effective-\\r\\nness of processes and people associated with the SOC. Understanding \\r\\nboth the operational and technical efficiency of the SOC is required to \\r\\nsuccessfully protect an organization from cyber threats and measure the \\r\\neffectiveness of the SOC.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"+ALkBGBMIcScxMmk4lRk4MKVhr95p4QjEH06zeUXzGc=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"c72072ad-06b2-49e6-b7aa-15ba93748596":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"c72072ad-06b2-49e6-b7aa-15ba93748596\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_2\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"A10298KPLjOyKtlV6wZFUmvZg7OTOJgVn9afZX5Weo4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"89c69d47-67cb-47c4-b2eb-d934cb731d75\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"+ALkBGBMIcScxMmk4lRk4MKVhr95p4QjEH06zeUXzGc=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"bfbb42c9-14f1-46f2-9927-a1356dab0659\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"mBbyiIqMWNosc5s3UtmFYuMLD06ltGPKVYlnxUoYod8=\"}},\"text\":\"The objective leads to the following research questions: (1) What \\r\\nframeworks are available to measure the performance of a SOC?(2) What \\r\\nare the commonly mentioned key metrics used to measure a SOC?(3) Can \\r\\nthe common metrics be used to measure the technical performance?(4) How \\r\\ncan the metrics be improved to enhance the reporting capabilities of technical \\r\\nperformance?The expected outcome of the research is a novel frame-\\r\\nwork that could contribute to an industry-standard way to measure the \\r\\ntechnical performance of a SOC and apply to most SOCs. 2.

Security operations center\\r\\nTo tackle the first phase of the design science research, problem iden-\\r\\ntification, we first introduce, how technical performance metrics target \\r\\nenvironments, i.e., SOCs, are described in the literature. One method to \\r\\ndescribe a SOC is through a People, Processes, and Technologies (PPT) \\r\\nframework (Knerler et al., 2022; Vielberth et al., 2020). Vielberth et al. (2020)summarized that the people block describes the people associ-\\r\\nated with the SOC and their required competencies, the process block \\r\\ndescribes how the people interact and how security incidents are han-\\r\\ndled, and the technology block describes the tools used to do the work. They also argued that the PPT framework could be expanded to in-\\r\\nclude governance and compliance, enabling organizations to utilize the \\r\\nSOC as a function to ensure compliance with various standards, such as \\r\\nISO/IEC 27001, GDPR, or PCI-DSS. Vielberth et al. (2020)stated, that the work performed at a SOC \\r\\nis heavily driven by processes, as the work is structured around the \\r\\nprevention, detection, and response of security incidents. The Com-\\r\\nputer Security Incident Handling Guide (NIST SP 800-61, Cichonski et \\r\\nal. (2012)) describes the security incident management process, which \\r\\nconsists of four phases “preparation,” “detection and analysis,” “con-\\r\\ntainment, eradication, and recovery,” and “post-incident activity,” as \\r\\ndepicted in Fig.1. The purpose of the preparation phase is to ensure the \\r\\nSOC has the necessary visibility and potential to detect and respond to \\r\\nsecurity incidents.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"mBbyiIqMWNosc5s3UtmFYuMLD06ltGPKVYlnxUoYod8=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"68a8878c-23f8-4dc3-847f-2d4808a43751":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"68a8878c-23f8-4dc3-847f-2d4808a43751\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_2\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"A10298KPLjOyKtlV6wZFUmvZg7OTOJgVn9afZX5Weo4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"bfbb42c9-14f1-46f2-9927-a1356dab0659\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"mBbyiIqMWNosc5s3UtmFYuMLD06ltGPKVYlnxUoYod8=\"}},\"text\":\"The preparation stage also includes activities aiming \\r\\nto prevent security incidents altogether, such as malware prevention or \\r\\nuser awareness training. The detection and analysis phase consists of \\r\\nresponding to security incidents by analyzing, documenting, and pri-\\r\\noritizing them and finally notifying the necessary people. The third \\r\\nphase is about containing the security incident by limiting the poten-\\r\\ntial damage the incident may cause, followed by evidence gathering \\r\\nand identifying the attackers’ host. Once the impact of the incident has \\r\\nbeen limited and the source of the attack has been identified, the threat \\r\\ncan be eradicated, and recovery actions can be started (Cichonski et al., \\r\\n2012).

Metrics and measurements\\r\\nThe primary purpose of a metric is to measure how well a business \\r\\nprocess, product, or resource performs so that a business decision can \\r\\nbe made Savola (2007). Typically, a metric consists of one or more dis-\\r\\ncrete point-in-time measurements, from which metrics are then derived. Savola (2013)continues that to produce quality metrics for security, the \\r\\nmetrics must conform to four fundamental quality criteria: correctness, \\r\\nmeasurability, meaningfulness, and usability. 4.1. Constructing metrics\\r\\nMetrics can be structured in multiple ways. A metric can simply \\r\\nbe a direct relation to a measurement, such as the number of security \\r\\nincidents, or it can be a composite metric constructed by multiple mea-\\r\\nsurements collected from multiple sources.

A metric may also be precisely wrong, meaning that something \\r\\nis measured with high accuracy, but the metric does not improve the \\r\\nbusiness process it is supposed to improve (Hauser and Katz, 1998).

Nonetheless, they \\r\\nfailed to show meaningful metrics in several areas, such as automation \\r\\n& orchestration, threat hunting, and detection engineering & validation. Nathans (2014)discussed SOC-related qualitative and quantitative \\r\\nmetrics utilized in managing a SOC.

The metrics related to the vulnerabilities are categorized \\r\\nas management-related metrics. He presented qualitative metrics, such \\r\\nas the top 10 vulnerable endpoints, and quantitative metrics, including \\r\\nthe number of vulnerable endpoints, the number of vulnerabilities per \\r\\nseverity, the number of unknown assets, and the time it took to apply a \\r\\npatch that fixed the vulnerability. However, the proposed metrics were \\r\\nnot sufficient to be used to demonstrate the technical capabilities of the \\r\\nSOC. Agyepong et al. (2020)presented a framework in which a SOC was \\r\\nsplit into multiple functions. Each function was measured separately to \\r\\ndetermine the actual performance of it.

Onwubiko (2015)presented a framework consisting of metrics used \\r\\nto evaluate SOCs’ performance and determine the return on investment.

The study \\r\\ncontained no metrics that directly relate to the technical performance \\r\\nof a SOC. However, several metrics are closely related to the typical \\r\\nactivities of the SOC, such as the business impact of security incidents, \\r\\ncharacteristics of security incidents, and system vulnerabilities. As a summary of SOC metrics, Table1describes the top thirty most \\r\\ncommonly mentioned metrics in the literature, i.e., the number aster-\\r\\nisks depict how many articles the metric was mentioned in. A full list of \\r\\nthe metrics observed has been published in Mendeley Data (Forsberg, \\r\\n2023). In Table1, one of the metrics was combined into a general-\\r\\nized term instead of having two separate rows for “time to resolution” \\r\\nand “time to incident closure. ” Another general level observation was \\r\\nthat the terminology does not appear to be consistent in the literature. For example, the metric “mean time to detect” is used to describe at \\r\\nleast two different behaviors, the time it takes to react and perform the \\r\\nanalysis of the alert (Ahlm, 2021; Agyepong et al., 2020; Crowley and \\r\\nPescatore, 2019) and time it takes for a SOC to become aware of the in-\\r\\ncident (Logsign, 2020; Vielberth et al., 2020).

the number of incidents is men-\\r\\ntioned as a specific metric in both NIST SP 800-53 and ISO/IEC 27004. It is a metric that can easily be collected and used outside of the scope \\r\\nof SOC. Vulnerability-related metrics are also relatively common, with \\r\\nthe count of vulnerabilities being mentioned in seven publications. The \\r\\nmean time to vulnerability remediation and the count of vulnerable de-\\r\\nvices were mentioned in four publications. Operative metrics, such as \\r\\nmean time to reaction, detection, resolution, containment, triage, and \\r\\nescalation, were also commonly mentioned. The publications also con-\\r\\ntained a few technical performance metrics. They were false-positive \\r\\nrate, threat actor attribution, the number of security incidents closed \\r\\nwith automation, and the quality of eradication.

Further-\\r\\nmore, based on the authors’ first-hand experience, many of the metrics \\r\\nused for measuring SOC are of low quality, particularly regarding bias \\r\\nand objectivity. This viewpoint is partially supported by Kokulu et al. (2019). However, the quality aspect of the metrics was not discussed in \\r\\ndetail in the SOC-related literature to form a valid conclusion about the \\r\\ninsufficient quality. To ensure the resulting metrics are of high quality, \\r\\nquality criteria for SOC metrics should be defined. The justification for the objectives 3 and 4 is the same, which is the \\r\\nuniversal applicability of the resulting metrics. In practice, this means \\r\\nthe metrics should be usable by most SOCs out there, provided that they \\r\\ninclude the function to which the metric is tied. Finally, the justification \\r\\nfor the objective 5 is that the metrics in some situations do not appear to \\r\\nbe backed up by scientific research, particularly regarding commercial \\r\\nsources, which means the metrics are purely based on the authority of \\r\\nthe author. 6.

Fig.7depicts two ways to present the metric, one as a combined \\r\\nbar and line chart and another as a line chart, depicting the evolution \\r\\nof the metric over time. The bar chart displays the number of distinct \\r\\nmonitoring rules and the sum of verifiable monitoring rules per MITRE \\r\\nATT&CK tactic. Next to the bars is a trend line displaying the percentage \\r\\nof verifiable monitoring rules. The value of the metric is the mean of the \\r\\npercentage of the monitoring rules covered per MITRE ATT&CK tactic \\r\\nat a given time. The intended way to interpret the metric is to follow \\r\\nthe trend of the mean to determine whether the SOC is improving over \\r\\ntime. For the metric to provide meaningful information, it needs a \\r\\ncounter-metric that displays the number of distinct monitoring rules, \\r\\nas shown in the blue bars in Fig.7. If the SOC has a low number of \\r\\nmonitoring rules, the metric value can be abnormally high, increas-\\r\\ning bias and decreasing the comparability of results between different \\r\\nSOCs. The number of monitoring rules can also be misleading, as there \\r\\nis a possibility of creating many low-fidelity monitoring rules. As the metric measures only the number of verifiable monitoring \\r\\nrules resulting from the SOC development efforts, it fails to demonstrate \\r\\nthe verification capabilities of native vendor detections.

A better solution would be to create a separate metric for measuring \\r\\nthe number of verifiable vendor-native scenarios and construct another \\r\\nmetric that considers both metrics.

Distribution of detections by source\\r\\nDistribution of detections by sourcemetric determines to what extent \\r\\nthe development efforts of a SOC can contribute to the detection of \\r\\nsecurity incidents. On a practical level, if a large portion of detections \\r\\noriginates from the native capabilities of the technologies in use, the \\r\\ndetection engineering function may not be able to provide additional \\r\\nvalue in the form of new monitoring rules. The metric can be tied to \\r\\na specific function, which is responsible for creating custom analytics \\r\\nwithin the SOC. The metric results are somewhat dependent on third \\r\\nparties, as the technologies selected to protect the environment have an \\r\\nimpact on the metric results. However, as the fundamental purpose is \\r\\nto compare the custom capabilities against the native capabilities, the \\r\\nmetric is not dependent on third parties but rather influenced by them, \\r\\nmaking the metric pass the requirement.

The demonstration of metrics with live data could also have been a \\r\\nvalid evaluation metric for the metrics, but due to the metrics requiring \\r\\nhistorical data to provide information other than a snapshot of the cur-\\r\\nrent state, the evaluation would require a longer period to be properly \\r\\nevaluated. In this research, the metrics have been tested with simulated \\r\\ndata during the creation process and the expectation is that the metrics \\r\\nbehave similarly when real-world measurements are used as a source \\r\\nfor the metrics. Before implementing the metrics, it is necessary to understand \\r\\nwhich measurements are required to construct the metrics and whether \\r\\nthey can be collected or not.

The metric number of verifiable monitoring ruleswas \\r\\nconsidered to be invalid by the criteria defined by the metric creation \\r\\nframework. The following section briefly discusses the measurements \\r\\nfor the metrics that are considered to be valid. The SOC is utilizing a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Re-\\r\\nsponse (SOAR) platform to manage the security incident management \\r\\nworkflows. In this particular SOC, the SOAR platform collects all detec-\\r\\ntions into a single pane of glass in the form of cases, which unifies the \\r\\nanalyst workflows across different environments and security products. The SOAR platform also produces a significant portion of the measure-\\r\\nments needed to construct metrics used to measure the performance of \\r\\nthe SOC.

All detections and resulting se-\\r\\ncurity incidents are classified on a high level either as false-positive, \\r\\ntrue-positive, or benign true-positive.

The escalation status can be derived from the escalation \\r\\ntarget group, but it is not explicitly recorded in the SOAR platform. As a part of the investigation workflows, the SOC is attempting to \\r\\nresolve unknown entities that are associated with the detection.

The decision to limit the number of iterations \\r\\nwas made due to constraints related to the research schedule and the \\r\\nfact that to properly evaluate the metrics, they would require years of \\r\\nmeasurements to be collected. Although the artifact was able to produce metrics that can be used \\r\\nto enhance the reporting capabilities of the technical performance of \\r\\na SOC, the link between the technical performance and the metric \\r\\ncreation framework could have been slightly more concrete. The frame-\\r\\nwork itself does not directly enforce the relationship between the met-\\r\\nrics and technical performance. This does not necessarily make the \\r\\ncriteria to be less useful, but it leaves the determination of whether \\r\\nthe resulting metric measures technical performance or not up to the \\r\\nuser of the artifact to decide. As an upside, the framework can also be \\r\\nused to create non-technical metrics. The literature review did not establish a clear pattern when it comes \\r\\nto the availability of SOC-related metrics, and as such, a conclusion \\r\\nwas reached that no such framework currently exists. Many of the more \\r\\ncommonly used metrics as summarized in Table1are operative, such as \\r\\nnumber of security incidents, mean time to reactionand mean time to reso-\\r\\nlution. As a result, they cannot be directly used to measure the technical \\r\\nperformance of a SOC. Although it could be argued that the technical \\r\\nperformance has a direct impact on the operational performance and \\r\\nas such, the operative metrics are also an indication of the technical \\r\\nperformance. However, as the operational metrics are also influenced \\r\\nby the process and people aspects of SOC, the metrics provide incon-\\r\\nclusive results when attempting to be used to measure the technical \\r\\nperformance. Some of the metrics can be used to partially measure the technical \\r\\nperformance, such as the false-positive rateor number of incidents handled \\r\\nautomatically, but they are at best imperfect when evaluated with the \\r\\nmetric creation framework, due to lack of additional context that causes \\r\\nthe metric to become overly biased. For example, a high true-positive \\r\\nrate, and subsequently a low false-positive rate, can be an indication of a \\r\\nwell-performing SOC but without understanding the detection strategy \\r\\nor level of automation, the metric alone can be misleading. The SOC \\r\\ncould automatically close a majority of the false-positive and benign \\r\\ntrue-positive detections, and instead use them for threat hunting or to \\r\\nprovide additional context in the form of potentially related low-fidelity \\r\\ndetections when investigating high-severity detections.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"fJTLCf8Icmo62XgK7kJez8RknNP24jQqG+sYi9uw1DE=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"b19442b2-ecd2-4cc9-a37f-1c9f04721036":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"b19442b2-ecd2-4cc9-a37f-1c9f04721036\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_12\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"BvbRvWAXVKmbGoxKoZOJFYoGKuvXplt006ZBxrw9YMs=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"2b7e1c4a-0d9b-4fac-a2f9-fbe9e609fe38\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"fJTLCf8Icmo62XgK7kJez8RknNP24jQqG+sYi9uw1DE=\"}},\"text\":\"The framework \\r\\ncan be used to enhance the reporting capabilities provided by these \\r\\ntechnical metrics, as it can be used to reduce both the bias and subjec-\\r\\ntivity as well as take into account the additional contextual information \\r\\nrequired to properly interpret the metric.

Furthermore, the academic research re-\\r\\nlated to modern SOC operations appears to also be limited and would \\r\\nrequire additional research, especially when it comes to the following \\r\\nquestions: (1) What are the technical success factors for SOCs? (2) What \\r\\nmakes an effective cyber defense program?, and (3) Should SOCs fo-\\r\\ncus more on proactive and preventative capabilities, rather than being \\r\\nmostly reactive? Answers to these questions would help with the cre-\\r\\nation of better metrics for measuring the technical performance of a \\r\\nSOC. Both academia and practitioners are encouraged to share metrics \\r\\nand ways to describe them, with the security community to enhance the \\r\\nmethods by which organizations can measure the effectiveness of their \\r\\nSOC deployment. In support of this initiative, the authors have pub-\\r\\nlished the source code for the metrics used to validate the framework \\r\\n(Forsberg, 2023). 10. Conclusions\\r\\nThe outcome of this research further emphasizes the need for better \\r\\ncapabilities to measure the technical performance of SOCs. The com-\\r\\nmonly used metrics focus on operational activities and are inadequate \\r\\nto measure the technical performance of a SOC. Furthermore, the met-\\r\\nrics observed in the literature do not appear to be a result of a systematic \\r\\ndevelopment but rather be loosely based on generic security metrics or \\r\\notherwise based on industry best practices without significant scientific \\r\\njustification. This research resulted in a design science artifact. A novel metric \\r\\ncreation framework that can be used to construct relevant metrics to \\r\\nmeasure both the technical and non-technical performance of a SOC.

However, \\r\\nwhen examined in light of the developed metric creation framework, \\r\\nthese metrics were found to benefit from additional context to be more \\r\\neffectively utilized. As a part of the demonstration of the artifact, four unique metrics \\r\\nwere created. Three of the four metrics were considered valid in terms \\r\\nof the metric creation framework. The metrics were validated by ver-\\r\\nifying that the measurements can be collected within a SOC service \\r\\nprovider. One of the key limitations of this study is the relatively narrow se-\\r\\nlection of metrics that were used to demonstrate the framework. The \\r\\nmetrics created with the framework are mostly related to the detection \\r\\ncapabilities of the SOC, and other functions, such as threat hunting or \\r\\ncyber threat intelligence, have not been included in the metrics chosen \\r\\nfor the demonstration. Therefore, whether the framework is suitable \\r\\nfor creating technical metrics for functions other than those that work \\r\\nclosely with the security incident management process remains un-\\r\\nknown. The wider demonstration was left to be researched in the future. Despite the minor limitations of the research, the framework and \\r\\nthe metrics used for demonstration can be adopted by SOCs to con-\\r\\nstruct metrics they can use to measure and demonstrate their techni-\\r\\ncal capabilities. Due to the lack of industry-standard reporting schema \\r\\nfor the technical performance of SOCs, the SOC industry as a whole \\r\\nis encouraged to enable industry-driven development of the measure-\\r\\nment capabilities, be open, and share the metrics they use to measure \\r\\ntheir technical capabilities with the wider community. In addition to \\r\\nindustry-backed development of technical performance measurement, \\r\\nadditional academic research is needed on the subject.

These endpoints are Internet-\\r\\n§Part of this work was performed while at Stevens Institute of Technology\\r\\nconnected devices of any kind, supplied by the organization\\r\\nor the individual, and are frequently used for a mix of profes-\\r\\nsional and personal activities [1, 86]. While the practice of endpoint security management is not\\r\\ncompletely new, and the proliferation of heterogeneous de-\\r\\nvices has been ongoing, we anticipate that SOCs will increas-\\r\\ningly be expected to perform these same functions with a far\\r\\nmore differentiated (by device characteristic) and distributed\\r\\n(by location) network perimeter.

Understanding\\r\\nthese new responsibilities as they relate to long-term end-\\r\\npoint monitoring trends, will be an important consideration\\r\\nfor future SOCs, their staff, and their organizations. Modern endpoint security management replaces old sys-\\r\\ntems with new technologiesandnew social policies, giving\\r\\nSOC staff highly granular control over both individual end-\\r\\ndevices (e.g., patch levels, firewall rules, installed applica-\\r\\ntions) and end-users (e.g., login frequency, location, file down-\\r\\nloads) [73, 114]. This control, in turn, contributes to the brittle\\r\\nstate of endpoint security management. This brittleness can be\\r\\nattributed to an increase in vulnerability to unforeseen interac-\\r\\ntion effects than previous sociotechnical systems of security\\r\\nmanagement [106–108].

Such client devices can  be, but are not limited\\r\\nto, laptops, smartphones, tablets, Internet-Of-Things devices,\\r\\nand even small-scale managed networking devices such as\\r\\nswitches. These endpoints are Internet-connected devices of\\r\\nany kind, supplied by the organization or the individual, and\\r\\nare frequently used for a mix of professional and personal\\r\\nactivities [1, 86]. Typical functions within endpoint security\\r\\nmanagement include endpoint inventory, adjusting system\\r\\nconfigurations, restricting access through content filtering,\\r\\nand more [18]. To protect not only these endpoints but also\\r\\nthe organization’s resources, Security Operation Centers tend\\r\\nto oversee endpoint security management [31]. Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are central compo-\\r\\nnents of modern enterprise networks. Organizations in indus-\\r\\ntry, government, and academia deploy SOCs to manage their\\r\\nnetworks, defend against cyber threats, and maintain regula-\\r\\ntory compliance [109, 113]. SOCs are organized in various\\r\\nways ranging from a flat structure to hierarchical tiers of ana-\\r\\nlysts, specialists, and managers [106, 107]. The structure and\\r\\nscope of the performed activities are mostly determined by\\r\\nthe organization’s size, services offered to its users, or its do-\\r\\nmain of activity. Albeit, all SOCs still perform certain core\\r\\nfunctions: incident management, monitoring and detecting\\r\\nthreats, security administration, architecture and engineering,\\r\\nand long-term planning [7, 31, 106, 118]. Just as each enter-\\r\\nprise network includes unique aspects in its configuration and\\r\\nlayout, so too are SOC tasks [106] and the maturity-level of a\\r\\nSOC [117].\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"GqckCORDrevQqJROknk3ADn7wdCa1OUP0UgbUx7A0v0=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2df1b67d-ab4d-4e13-877d-81eaed52eee0":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2df1b67d-ab4d-4e13-877d-81eaed52eee0\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_2\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"NkFtklH/Xg/R7jZY6L+b+RwbncYCjtoPuZQHKRwLciw=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"23da1a80-08d0-4f05-9ebf-0c47ece50ce6\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"GqckCORDrevQqJROknk3ADn7wdCa1OUP0UgbUx7A0v0=\"}},\"text\":\"Even the names that fall under the broad SOC um-\\r\\nbrella may be different across organizations e.g., Computer\\r\\nSecurity Incident Response Team (CSIRT) [29, 107], Net-\\r\\nwork Operations Center (NOC) [106], Network and Security\\r\\nOperations Center (NSOC) [108], Cybersecurity Operations\\r\\nCenter (CSOC) [48], Security and Compliance Center [106],\\r\\nManaged Security Service Provider (MSSP) [10], etc. Prior bodies  of  work  studied  SOCs  by  conducting  sur-\\r\\nveys [31, 101, 103, 118], interviewing analysts [7, 9, 69] or\\r\\nperforming participant observation [106–109].

This survey\\r\\ncovered 393 SOC employees and asked about the effects upon\\r\\nthe security posture (26% of respondents reported a worse se-\\r\\ncurity posture), the number of alerts (42% reported increased\\r\\nalerts), and the incoming phishing emails (57% reported a\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"FS0ydsjuHwxC1rZReS3m1hFeBJsJ7gbcmTdsVwybc18=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"dfffddbf-1ef6-498b-b7d0-235168e3b9a1":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"dfffddbf-1ef6-498b-b7d0-235168e3b9a1\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_3\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"oN5GcER6DXoSnqjnEP7bSaZLlODXzX3pgwKWBLOviMk=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"49ae24f1-f288-466a-9e7c-396f8c6c186a\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"34xd88XntxuVS/Yd4/dM3TXZo/F5ZouGrFlkWhKgeow=\"}},\"text\":\"rise). Additionally, they find that investigating suspicious ac-\\r\\ntivities, collaborating, and communicating has become more\\r\\nchallenging in this environment. Another survey, covering 150\\r\\nsecurity and technology leaders, focused upon COVID-19’s\\r\\nWFH phenomena [16]. The majority of the respondents be-\\r\\nlieve that their current infrastructure supports WFH, and that\\r\\ntheir security posture can handle the risks. Some respondents\\r\\nreported a high volume of attacks and adopted new services\\r\\nin lieu of COVID-19 [16]. Lastly, a survey conducted by Cy-\\r\\nbersecurity Insiders across 287 cybersecurity professionals,\\r\\nfound the majority of respondents still work from home. Many\\r\\nare worried about securing network access, personal devices,\\r\\nand installed applications which pose data leakage risks, while\\r\\nsome respondents are concerned with (1) users’ exposure to\\r\\nmalware and phishing and (2) unmanaged endpoints [21, 22]. It is apparent that SOCs are complex structures with vary-\\r\\ning names, operations, and challenges. It is also plausible\\r\\nthat technically analyzing a plethora of SOCs may not com-\\r\\npletely capture COVID-19’s impact. In our work, we proceed\\r\\nwith a multi-layered approach. We leverage historical anal-\\r\\nysis methods to uncover long-term trends and study a SOC\\r\\nwith anthropological approaches to help support our historical\\r\\nfindings. We further generalize our findings by conducting\\r\\nsurveys with seven other SOCs representing various sectors\\r\\n(academic, government, and industry). 3  Methodology, Data, and Participants\\r\\nThis study leverages historical and ethnographic methodolo-\\r\\ngies to investigate a SOC’s role in  endpoint management\\r\\nwithin the context of WFH. Studying individual SOCs is the\\r\\nmain route to detailed information about their operations and\\r\\nstaff, but if used as the sole analysis, it does not permit us\\r\\nto extrapolate larger trends. To provide an explanation of\\r\\nthe changes we now see underway, we require methods that\\r\\ncan both (1) elucidate the causal mechanisms behind SOC\\r\\noperations (i.e., a bottom-up analysis), and (2) explain how\\r\\nthose operations fit into the larger domain of SOCs and their\\r\\ntrajectory (i.e., a top-down analysis). Moreover, to confirm\\r\\nthat our observations in the context of COVID-19 are not\\r\\nspecific to only one SOC, we quantitatively interviewed seven\\r\\nother SOCs.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"u6eJwWrDaO9lnt9BcPGl5KIC8FKeyxawsJhvnNDjXng=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"49ae24f1-f288-466a-9e7c-396f8c6c186a":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"49ae24f1-f288-466a-9e7c-396f8c6c186a\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_3\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"oN5GcER6DXoSnqjnEP7bSaZLlODXzX3pgwKWBLOviMk=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"dfffddbf-1ef6-498b-b7d0-235168e3b9a1\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"u6eJwWrDaO9lnt9BcPGl5KIC8FKeyxawsJhvnNDjXng=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"15a09425-485d-4e50-afce-9ad8581fa640\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"Ozsdl1+6f0tW542zKcqC0goL39KqZ28dcGdzashvpgM=\"}},\"text\":\"Figure 1 illustrates the high-level procedures and\\r\\nmethods taken to conduct this study. 3.1  Historical Analysis\\r\\nOur historical analysis aims to understand, within larger-scale\\r\\nchange, the trajectory of endpoint control in present-day SOCs\\r\\nduring the WFH phenomenon triggered by COVID-19.

History Museum [30]), which provide certainty as to a piece\\r\\nof evidence’s providence. As shown in Algorithm 1, we begin\\r\\nthe historical analysis with these listed sources. Keywords and Filtering: This line of historical inquiry in-\\r\\ncludes better-known phenomena and events, such as, the emer-\\r\\ngence of the Security Operations Center. We focus on histori-\\r\\ncal trends in the monitoring and management of networked,\\r\\nlocal host machines, or endpoints by first searching for the\\r\\nphrase \\\"endpoint management\\\" and working backwards in\\r\\ntime from the first account of \\\"endpoint management\\\" to the\\r\\nfirst known instance of securing endpoints. Next, we explain\\r\\nthese trends by revealing their origins in (1) broad functional\\r\\nrequirements that arise from a combination of the network and\\r\\nhost architectures, and (2) the scale, kinds, and geographic\\r\\ndistribution of use. In other words, we look for fundamental\\r\\nchanges to endpoints that would negatively impact endpoint\\r\\nsecurity management during that era. After analyzing the re-\\r\\nsulting documents, we continue to extract common phrases\\r\\nused under the context contained within multiple selected\\r\\ntexts (e.g., \\\"NOC\\\", \\\"SOC\\\", \\\"content handling\\\", \\\"acceptable\\r\\nuse policies\\\"). As our terminology expanded, our inquiry led\\r\\nus to phenomena that, while uncontroversial, fall outside of\\r\\nthe usual scope of Internet history. Such phenomena include\\r\\nthe basic security practices of 1970s and 1980s campus and\\r\\noffice computer labs, such as \\\"keycard locks\\\" and \\\"antivirus\\r\\nsoftware\\\". We select accounts which were professionally ref-\\r\\nereed, and which appear (retrospectively against the historical\\r\\nrecord) to reflect standard or increasingly standard practices. The list of keywords and the corresponding resources is avail-\\r\\nable in Appendix A.1 – Table 5. As we broaden our scope more towards present-day whilst\\r\\nadding peripheral context, the amount of relevant work dras-\\r\\ntically accumulates.

Although some of the communica-\\r\\ntion occurred through e-mail and Microsoft Teams [78] prior\\r\\nto WFH, the WFH transition increased this type of digital\\r\\ncommunication and video conference calls. Grounded Theory Method:  We  used  Grounded  Theory\\r\\nMethod (GTM) to analyze the 352 collected field notes (addi-\\r\\ntional details of which can be found in Appendix A.2). GTM\\r\\nallows us to create theories using interviews and/or partici-\\r\\npant observation field notes. This approach has been leveraged\\r\\nin previous works to uncover user perceptions’ around pri-\\r\\nvacy [3] and cryptocurrency [72] as well as modelling analyst\\r\\nburnout [106]. Thus, GTM allows us to uncover and extract\\r\\nmeaningful themes of SOCs in the context of COVID-19. Prior to COVID-19, we focused on analyzing cybersecurity\\r\\nmetrics. Our focus of SOCs, with respect to COVID-19, redi-\\r\\nrects our analysis to attempt to answer the following open-\\r\\nended questions: (1) what happens to a real-world security\\r\\nenvironment during a crisis and (2) how do tools, services,\\r\\nand analysts “react” to the unexpected circumstances?\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"KDOFRfMYyFmE0nlsTmXwpn8sayqW9J4HJIJ288C/+lQ=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"eb6e3603-4ef3-4efd-8f2d-249bd63a16c6":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"eb6e3603-4ef3-4efd-8f2d-249bd63a16c6\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_5\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"cChgR4kfZixJZ9BPXurQOrkHezC6CoCuF7aOWYjZGz8=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"5a5b784d-68f0-4952-a3e0-845c66f2089a\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"KDOFRfMYyFmE0nlsTmXwpn8sayqW9J4HJIJ288C/+lQ=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"76fe2630-3ad6-48d5-a663-2d362c01e8f2\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"CtOm+DJZcvf2D0hBmWG/56IrjmieSANpB9wAExPo7nE=\"}},\"text\":\"With our defined research questions, we iteratively ana-\\r\\nlyzed field notes by following GTM’s three steps: open cod-\\r\\ning, axial coding, and selective coding [104]. The first itera-\\r\\ntion, open coding, involves parsing the field notes to identify\\r\\ninsights and uncover potential phenomena by labelling ob-\\r\\nservations known as codes throughout the documents. After\\r\\nidentifying our codes, we performed axial coding which con-\\r\\nsists of combining the previous codes from open coding into\\r\\nlarger themes.

The codebook is included in Appendix (Table 7). Semi-structured Interviews:   To  validate,  or  invalidate,\\r\\nthemes extracted by GTM, we conducted two rounds of live\\r\\n30-minute, semi-structured interviews with eight internal SOC\\r\\nemployees for a total of 12 interviews (as seen in Table 1).

The DCA\\r\\nfurther developed its requirements for organizational manage-\\r\\nment of endpoints and added centralized access control to the\\r\\ndial-in points [44]. Meanwhile, PCs began replacing terminal\\r\\nrooms and computer service centers [24]. All of these changes differentiated the network edge be-\\r\\nyond a smaller number of highly managed and physically con-\\r\\ntrolled machines. To account for the fragmentation, DARPA\\r\\ndirected the implementation of the Domain Name System\\r\\nresulting in a new set of regulations and organizational re-\\r\\nquirements [105]: local security policies to prohibit misuse\\r\\nand to ensure proper technical configuration [89, 90]. The\\r\\nlocal computing facilities connected to this network, how-\\r\\never, remained largely the same. Excluding sites with strict\\r\\ninformation security (e.g. government classification), com-\\r\\nputer labs and centers enforced “acceptable use” through both\\r\\norganizational and technical means [2, 82].

Although network encryption was introduced in\\r\\n1970s, we see the phrase \\\"endpoint encryption\\\" termed during\\r\\nthis time [37,51].

Thus, we\\r\\nsuggest thatany present-day expansion of largely technical\\r\\nendpoint control mechanisms reflects one period in a longer\\r\\nseries of changes that predate COVID-19. Endpoint management is carried out through a mix of or-\\r\\nganizational and technological means. These organizational\\r\\nmeans are simply the structured (or programmed) human ac-\\r\\ntivity necessary to operate complex technical systems (e.g.,\\r\\nin-person lab monitoring and ticketing systems). In the histori-\\r\\ncal scholarship, these organizational means are less prominent,\\r\\nbecause we suggest that they are not classified as important in-\\r\\nnovations or technological accomplishments – many of these\\r\\norganizational mechanisms predate even the Arpanet [91]. We interpret this history to suggest that the organizationally\\r\\ninstituted endpoint management techniquesworked, in part\\r\\nbecause they managed simpler systems with fewer threats. When organizational techniques became too labor-intensive\\r\\nor lost effectiveness due to the changing contexts, administra-\\r\\ntors turned to technological solutions, and thus to a drive to\\r\\nautomate. Through Internet history, endpoint management un-\\r\\nderwent a process of automation, whereby manual tasks were\\r\\npartially replaced with combinations of digital computation\\r\\nand (likely fewer, and perhaps different) manual tasks. As the endpoints moved beyond the domain of local orga-\\r\\nnizational control–either in new distributed forms through-\\r\\nout an organization, or completely outside the organization\\r\\nitself–the effectiveness of organizational management tech-\\r\\nniques for endpoint systemsmust havedeclined dramatically. This decline, in turn, triggered technological solutions, or re-\\r\\nplacements, for these formerly manual tasks (i.e., automation). Given resource constraints in the contexts under study, we\\r\\nassume that investments from the enterprise network’s man-\\r\\nagement, who oversees operation and security, were made\\r\\nout of necessity. We argue that the widespread nature of the\\r\\nchanges documented here further rules out highly localized,\\r\\ncultural, or irrational causes in general–and instead points\\r\\nto shared organizational and technological solutions to chal-\\r\\nlenges posed by the changing technical and use environment. 5  Ethnographic Analysis of a SOC in the U.S. In this section, we discuss our discoveries from studying a\\r\\nhierarchical-structured U.S. SOC securing over 30,000 users.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"0ZcaN42bVJ7NBqYz/Suvno1+ZLUNnp+dLR7BWs26W8k=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"c6a586a4-f610-43ab-a2aa-f3be31500e57":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"c6a586a4-f610-43ab-a2aa-f3be31500e57\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":8,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_8\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":8,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"CLOZgETBktesxnVokfMO1lAdXLMHgBIHUZAok1f+AZ4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"c480f71e-407c-4a90-9964-61c669397ae4\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":8,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"0ZcaN42bVJ7NBqYz/Suvno1+ZLUNnp+dLR7BWs26W8k=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"6dbac42c-1117-44f2-9237-f478475733c5\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":8,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"0Q3xt6UJCp7o0Iq0nKeC8e2YdW9lC0UEjE1d7EjUzlk=\"}},\"text\":\"SOC securing over 30,000 users.

SOC was forced to temporarily oversee these security-related\\r\\noperations in addition to the SOC’s current tasks. To summarize, the SOC balanced increasing the cybersecu-\\r\\nrity tools’ capacity and overseeing additional security tasks\\r\\nwhilst the organization demanded more of their time. Monitoring (Mid-Late March 2020): To ensure the organi-\\r\\nzation can still operate, both users and employees who did\\r\\nnot have an organization-owned device were offered one, thus\\r\\nthe number of deployed endpoints increased. However, the\\r\\nanalysts quickly highlighted the dangers of this such as doc-\\r\\numenting the device inventory going home with end users. Notably, P5 expressed their concerns regarding device inven-\\r\\ntory,“I’m concerned about endpoint monitoring and endpoint\\r\\npatching. I want to know what was taken off-campus and if\\r\\neveryone told the correct personnel to keep track of inventory. ”\\r\\nThis concern’s motivation comes from (1) how the physical\\r\\nnetwork location is an important indicator for threat detection,\\r\\nand (2) if new security-related technology needs to be in-\\r\\nstalled on these endpoints, the SOC needs to determine which\\r\\nendpoints currently do or do not have that protection. “It doesn’t do any good to provide security on campus\\r\\nwhen there isn’t anyone there anymore.”(P2) Aside from the\\r\\nincreased endpoints, yet a lack of device inventory, the ana-\\r\\nlysts were also concerned with the decreased transparency of\\r\\ntheir endpoints’ actions. Within our SOC, there was a heavy\\r\\nreliance upon the firewall and network access points for net-\\r\\nwork transparency. However, all of these devices shifted from\\r\\nleveraging the campus’ physical access points protected by\\r\\nfirewalls to leveraging home or public networks. In other\\r\\nwords, the origin of network traffic moved from mainly in-\\r\\nbound to outbound, meaning they were no longer covered by\\r\\nthe organization’s firewall. Although a virtual private network\\r\\n(VPN) will route traffic behind the firewall, not all users in-\\r\\nstalled, or use the SOC-controlled VPN.

This was particularly evident when another simi-\\r\\nlarly structured organization was targeted by ransomware. As P5 fearfully expressed,“the news out of [organization’s]\\r\\nransomware attack is dire.”and P2 shared this concerned sen-\\r\\ntiment. This ransomware exploits unpatched vulnerabilities,\\r\\ntargets user accounts and performs spear-phishing attacks. Securing these vectors requires endpoint patching and mon-\\r\\nitoring incoming emails [110]. This attack was particularly\\r\\nmotivating for the SOC not only because of the attack’s suc-\\r\\ncess as P5 shows,“... 1) It seems likely it’s Netwalker, which\\r\\nis the same ransomware that hit [an organization]. 2) They\\r\\nactually paid”, but in addition, it highlights the lack of end-\\r\\npoint management in which the SOC is no exception:“We\\r\\nalso need to assume that personal devices are a serious threat\\r\\nhere since we cannot enforce any kind of controls over them\\r\\nwith our current toolset. I believe [vendor] has tools we can\\r\\npush out via the VPN client which would help but is not a\\r\\nperfect solution since not everyone is using the VPN.”(P5). In other words, personal devices located on the end user’s\\r\\npersonal network pose a large problem to work computers. On top of the issues directly facing the SOC, the organi-\\r\\nzation imposed changes upon all the departments that con-\\r\\ntradicted with the SOC’s needs. During WFH, a few projects\\r\\ncould impact end users such as moving email inboxes into\\r\\nthe cloud, automatically installing client-side software for\\r\\nincreased security, or deploying self-phishing exercises. At-\\r\\ntempting to continue these efforts posed a risk of disrupting\\r\\nthe organization’s end users, thus these projects were tem-\\r\\nporarily suspended. This means that all of IT temporarily\\r\\npaused projects to allow users to adjust to WFH which con-\\r\\nflicted with the SOC’s attempt to re-establish better security\\r\\ntools in hopes to increase transparency.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"4PojoGI/VjGLyrq+/wmcjElsSlT6lh88z5gJri0WVtI=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"f4653ab7-b738-4602-9189-174ac075472d":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"f4653ab7-b738-4602-9189-174ac075472d\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":10,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_10\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":10,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"Qu054Kunb8/ppQVcDJVZTHTJr0n4NdIUBUIxNyGMxSc=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"0ef6bf76-e82e-47b1-b882-dfdd586e568e\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":10,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"16yv0BPUuFTXOxmh+DuUSuVkVTuxTTp/ayCQKprfv0Q=\"}},\"text\":\"Suspicious Emails Reported by Users     Counts     Percentage\\r\\nLegitimate Emails                                    1,964        8.6%\\r\\nMalicious - Non COVID-19                     19,819      87.5%\\r\\nMalicious - COVID-19                            880           3.9%\\r\\nTotal                                                         22,647      100%\\r\\nTable 3:  Statistics of COVID-19’s impact on incoming, un-\\r\\nblocked emails from January 1, 2020 to February 1, 2022.

Short-Term Response (April-July 2020):  Another prior-\\r\\nity, labor-wise, was an increased effort on monitoring and\\r\\nmanaging malicious emails. In particular, the organization\\r\\nexperienced an influx of malicious emails taking advantage of\\r\\nthe pandemic which coincides with SIEMplify’s survey [101]. Because these emails contained terminology/text specific to\\r\\nCOVID-19, the SOC released public communication reports\\r\\nwhich (P5) helped develop,“are there any other COVID-19\\r\\nemails you could forward to me? I’m working up a memo”. These experiences paired with public articles highlighting\\r\\nrecent COVID-19 scams (i.e., one manager requested a corre-\\r\\nlation between a public dataset and the organization’s email\\r\\ndataset), increased the priority of monitoring incoming emails\\r\\nand resulted in a new script to calculate the distribution of\\r\\nemails specific to COVID-19. Attackers also filed fraudulent\\r\\nunemployment claims that affected organization’s employ-\\r\\nees who would forward those emails to the SOC. These two\\r\\nevents increased the SOC’s pressure on monitoring emails. The SOC employs two main techniques when stopping\\r\\nthese types of attacks (blocking malicious URLs and pulling\\r\\nemails from inboxes). Thus, we wanted to better quantify\\r\\nthe impact on  COVID-19 related emails. We numerically\\r\\nanalyzed malicious COVID-19 emailsreporteddirectly to\\r\\nthe SOC between January 1, 2020 to February 1, 2022 as\\r\\nseen in Table 3.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"XPUusx7EpAjpHrvnoeBvNFl+pHzAaIrMVw/5tBwxL2o=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"0ef6bf76-e82e-47b1-b882-dfdd586e568e":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"0ef6bf76-e82e-47b1-b882-dfdd586e568e\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":10,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_10\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":10,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"Qu054Kunb8/ppQVcDJVZTHTJr0n4NdIUBUIxNyGMxSc=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"f4653ab7-b738-4602-9189-174ac075472d\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":10,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"XPUusx7EpAjpHrvnoeBvNFl+pHzAaIrMVw/5tBwxL2o=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"c09aaf26-c6f8-4b45-b780-324797ed4f9b\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":10,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"p+cpmiISLnoUQy9+YmQ+dd6Avl7N4gocR+Z3cfsj8U4=\"}},\"text\":\"Out of the 22,647 reported emails during\\r\\nthis duration, 19,819 emails were malicious with 880 of those\\r\\nmalicious emails mentioning COVID-19 within the content. Protecting users from email is not the SOC’s only moti-\\r\\nvation. The SOC also wanted to proactively protect the end-\\r\\npoints’ applications. Additional controls are required to in-\\r\\ncrease endpoint protection, but the SOC’s pre-WFH security\\r\\nsolutions were no longer sufficient. To address this short-\\r\\ncoming, the SOC focused on re-tuning applications such as\\r\\nZoom [123]. The SOC required adjustments to Zoom across\\r\\nall users such as pushing out updates and mandating security\\r\\nsettings for all users,“FYI the Zoom changes went through\\r\\nlast night. Password required on all Zoom meetings after\\r\\nthe change (this can’t be shut off) and caller ID masking\\r\\nis enabled for dial in users”(P5). For a clearer understand-\\r\\ning, we calculated the number of times an article covering\\r\\nZoom vulnerabilities was shared amongst the team. Between\\r\\nMarch 15th and December 31st of 2020, the SOC shared 220\\r\\nURLs  containing  various  security information  with 14  of\\r\\nthese URLs discussing the latest Zoom vulnerabilities. Aside from reconfiguring applications, the SOC focused on\\r\\ntheir current cybersecurity toolset and adjusted technical set-\\r\\ntings particularly within the anti-virus application: increasing\\r\\npassword complexity requirements (i.e., credential protec-\\r\\ntion), preventing certain applications from executing through\\r\\nthe preexisting anti-virus, and privilege escalation prevention. Not only are these controls similar to endpoint protection, but\\r\\nthey also protect against data loss stemming from the user,\\r\\nwhich in turn protects the organization from compromised\\r\\nuser accounts [77, 102, 115, 119].

We define SOC\\r\\ncontent handling as actions taken to prevent users from ac-\\r\\ncessing the organizations’ resources based upon the content’s\\r\\nsemantic meaning. In this case, the SOC is looking at the\\r\\nsemantic-meaning of data passed through the network. Conditional access is another technique used to protect\\r\\nthe organization by restricting endpoints. In this work, we\\r\\ndefine conditional access as the action to restrict endpoint’s\\r\\naccess to specified resources typically based upon semantic\\r\\ninformation. The SOC attended training webinars and tested\\r\\nin-place applications that could potentially limit user’s ac-\\r\\ncess to software applications and data. In order to implement\\r\\nconditional access, analysts determine high-risk features and\\r\\nprevent certain devices with those identified features from\\r\\nobtaining important resources. For example, one discussion\\r\\nrevolved around preventing devices running end-of-life Win-\\r\\ndows 7 from accessing cloud-based storage. Even though these changes are motivated with good inten-\\r\\ntions (e.g., protect the organization from threat actors), we\\r\\nnoted a decrease in end-user’s right to privacy. User devices\\r\\nare not restricted to organizational use and in fact, can be\\r\\nused for personal matters.

Under the regular operating procedure,\\r\\ndevices were isolated or blocked from the enterprise network\\r\\nwhen suspicious network traffic to and/or from those devices\\r\\nwas detected. Once a device was blocked, its user/users and\\r\\nthe corresponding network administrator were identified and\\r\\nthen notified.Only then, depending on the type of compro-\\r\\nmise and the involved user account(s), the SOC accessed the\\r\\ndevice and analyzed information directly on that endpoint. With no or very limited network traffic to serve as a warrant\\r\\nfor identifying malicious behavior during WFH, the SOC had\\r\\nto compensate for the lack of visibility by relying on a contin-\\r\\nuous access to endpoint devices that monitor very detailed and\\r\\nin-depth system behavior, system contents, and user activity\\r\\n(similar to a constant search without a warrant/preliminary\\r\\nindicator).

Based on our\\r\\nethnographic methods, we identified our SOC’s trajectory\\r\\nchange from maturing (e.g., training staff, configuring SIEMs,\\r\\nautomating redundant tasks) to solely deploying and config-\\r\\nuring automated endpoint security management tools. The semi-structured interviews contributed to confirming\\r\\nthat the motivation of this shift was COVID-19’s WFH phe-\\r\\nnomena. Lastly, based on our surveys, other SOCs with a local,\\r\\ncentralized workforce were similarly affected and worked to-\\r\\nwards improved endpoint security. With these findings, we\\r\\nsuggest that this pushreflects an intensified periodof end-\\r\\npoint security management. Furthermore, we note that even\\r\\nthough BYOD previously brought very similar challenges,\\r\\nmany current endpoint security tools are costly, thus we also\\r\\nsuggest this intensified period forced many lagging SOCs to,\\r\\nmore permanently, invest into endpoint security [19]. A Regulatory Environment for SOCs: While the organi-\\r\\nzational management of endpoints  is  old, SOCs  and their\\r\\npredecessors have, traditionally, used their technology to man-\\r\\nage network components, not endpoints. This has spared them\\r\\nfrom some of the legal and social issues that arise when se-\\r\\nmantically richcontentis handled (e.g., end user browsing\\r\\nbehavior) [122]. We believe that this turn to endpoint control\\r\\nis extremely significant insofar as SOCs come to be expected\\r\\nor seen as a site of content-aware monitoring. With locally-\\r\\ninstalled applications on computers used for professional and\\r\\npotentially for personal use, not only does transparency in-\\r\\ncrease but also the level of control a SOC can apply to these\\r\\ndevices such as blocking URLs to websites, removing emails\\r\\nfrom inboxes, or opening well-known ports for better access. Content monitoring is more easily drawn into culture wars\\r\\nand could even spark calls for regulation [20]. Based on our\\r\\nstudy, we believe SOCs must cautiously proceed with tech-\\r\\nnical actions and consider the sociotechnical aspect behind\\r\\nimplementing endpoint security management. Another Stimulus of Burnout:  After the initial shock of\\r\\nCOVID-19, a lot of pressures continued to weigh on the SOC\\r\\nanalysts.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"+VTdjPI0NJ/QnG0A1eBC1t/EX/NDfSzuLZYJVOGQu6c=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"85e8e423-7b27-4330-b6f2-46b0bc073b51":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"85e8e423-7b27-4330-b6f2-46b0bc073b51\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_13\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"VtMV0elxy1xSN8TRgKJlBnrU+MEDq9z6eBV5y7QNEYc=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"8a12d4a1-a337-47ba-87af-35e65ecd475d\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"+VTdjPI0NJ/QnG0A1eBC1t/EX/NDfSzuLZYJVOGQu6c=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"6b13b7c6-afc3-4e52-a994-f9d5a0f15f59\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"W5v9oECrfVAO/wE/xEKPf1+wCielaS9JnKXgIszwWI4=\"}},\"text\":\"We saw organization budget cuts resulting in a re-\\r\\nduced salary across all SOC employees, restrictions upon\\r\\nadopting new (proprietary) security-oriented tools, a drop\\r\\nin training opportunities, and incidents over vacation days. Corroborated with various external events (e.g., [6] vulnera-\\r\\nbility, [39]), these factors weighed heavily in the decision of\\r\\nSOC personnel to leave their jobs. Action Item 1 - Device coverage: Lack of transparency was\\r\\nprominent during COVID-19’s WFH yet transparency is an\\r\\nimportant factor in securing systems [43]. Our case study SOC\\r\\nwas able to reconfigure, re-purpose and integrate existing ser-\\r\\nvices into operations whilst recognizing their remaining ineffi-\\r\\nciencies. However, with such a distributed network boundary,\\r\\nendpoint security management focused tools may still not be\\r\\nenough to protect resources. Rather than control all endpoints\\r\\nfrom a network-focused perspective, a Zero Trust perspective\\r\\nmay be more appropriate. Specifically, SOCs should already\\r\\nassume devices are compromised. This allows SOCs to focus\\r\\nmore upon enforcing controls tailored to critical threats (e.g.,\\r\\nlateral movement, data breaches etc. ) rather than protecting all\\r\\nendpoints [95]. Our SOC and its parent organization started\\r\\ndedicating resources to enabling such a shift. Action Item 2 - Tracking time for training: Although a Zero-\\r\\nTrust-oriented effort may be warranted, we note that this ap-\\r\\nproach requires processes, technology, and people to imple-\\r\\nment [95]. As we found through participant observation and\\r\\ninterviews, many pressures during COVID-19 led to burnout,\\r\\nand these needed resources may not be available to SOCs. Thus, we also propose that SOCs should track time spend\\r\\non training. Many SOCs may have quickly adopted endpoint\\r\\nsecurity management yet may have failed to provide training\\r\\n- particularly towards user-device monitoring challenges (e.g.,\\r\\ncontinuous browsing history to user attribution). We believe\\r\\nthis will help realign SOCs towards increasing maturity. Action Item 3 - Documentation and data needs: Managing\\r\\ncomplex controls in modern endpoint management systems\\r\\ncan be burdensome [73]. Thus, SOCs should ensure that re-\\r\\nstrictions upon semantic content are strictly security-related\\r\\nrather than motivated by other factors. We believe this can be\\r\\naccomplished by documenting policies surrounding the expec-\\r\\ntations of end user privacy.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"DCP1be+kPhpVKT7AAMEQ/PU1vYOpX5XGb5vhMTf3nBc=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"6b13b7c6-afc3-4e52-a994-f9d5a0f15f59":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"6b13b7c6-afc3-4e52-a994-f9d5a0f15f59\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_13\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"VtMV0elxy1xSN8TRgKJlBnrU+MEDq9z6eBV5y7QNEYc=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"85e8e423-7b27-4330-b6f2-46b0bc073b51\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"DCP1be+kPhpVKT7AAMEQ/PU1vYOpX5XGb5vhMTf3nBc=\"}},\"text\":\"We also believe that these policies\\r\\ncan  help the  SOC  formulate  their precise  data  needs  and\\r\\nin turn potentially reduce user-device content-aware-related\\r\\nchallenges.

This section is focused\\r\\non providing additional details about the initial involved en-\\r\\ntities such as ARPA/DARPA and DCA. Moreover, Table 5\\r\\ncaptures the list of keywords resulting from our historical\\r\\nanalysis methodology. The Early Operational Arpanet (1972-1979): The US Ad-\\r\\nvanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) became the De-\\r\\nfense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1972,\\r\\nwith a brief 1993-96 return to ARPA [32]. ARPA began its\\r\\nlife as a four-node testbed in 1969, and reached basic func-\\r\\ntionality by late 1972 with working host software for common\\r\\noperating systems, remote login (telnet), file transfer (FTP),\\r\\nelectronic mail (SNDMSG and CPYNET) and the formal role\\r\\nof the Network Control Center (NCC) [2, 76, 87]. However,\\r\\nend systems were often shared mainframe systems [76]. Out-\\r\\nside of limited TCP/IP experiments, LAN endpoints directly\\r\\nconnected to a local Arpanet host, and were not nameable or\\r\\naddressable on the Arpanet itself [4, 66]. Bolt Beranek Newman  (BBN), the contractor that built\\r\\nthe subnetwork and operated it through its Network Control\\r\\nCenter (NCC; the direct predecessor to the Network Oper-\\r\\nations  Center), knew the  topology through a  combination\\r\\nof manual and technical means that were increasingly auto-\\r\\nmated over time [41]. The NCC could disconnect any host\\r\\nif it caused problems for the network [74, 75]. In 1975 the\\r\\nDefense Communications Agency (DCA, current DISA) in-\\r\\ntroduced formal rules for local management of end systems,\\r\\nwhich were implemented by a “network liaison” at each site\\r\\nfor all Arpanet-connected systems [34, 35, 42], all coordinated\\r\\nthrough another DARPA contractor, the Stanford Research\\r\\nInstitute (SRI) and its Network Information Center (NIC).\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"TfYYexJkulgjXV84DOwd66Mvh9RV/lXab0BVnSyYw5U=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"80ef981c-56c0-445f-ab67-a9053cd98ae9":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"80ef981c-56c0-445f-ab67-a9053cd98ae9\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":16,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_16\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":16,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"kzFiSWb1qUDf/3E/PsGDoNTTaP7W8JwFpkt7muqNK2M=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"fdca5bd4-29a0-4959-aa6e-1fd5fddc833d\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":16,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"TfYYexJkulgjXV84DOwd66Mvh9RV/lXab0BVnSyYw5U=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"86557473-e152-4bed-b525-faddd010d9a3\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":16,\"file_path\":\"D:\\\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\\\Data\\\\Projects\\\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\\\chatbot-manin\\\\backend\\\\data\\\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"r3EG7D22cLE2CGg7Z4cNbBsObJL+hYBdYdjL2CXnYBQ=\"}},\"text\":\"The ARPA Internet (1980-1986): The Arpanet served as the\\r\\nmain testbed for the TCP/IP suite from the mid-late 1970s, and\\r\\nbecame the Internet’s backbone from 1983-86 (the Arpanet’s\\r\\nlast nodes were decommissioned in 1990) [96]. The Arpanet\\r\\nera  also  initiated the  Internet’s  globally unique  addresses\\r\\nmapped to network interfaces [97], an open application layer,\\r\\nglobal name mapping to addresses [2, 120], end-to-end cryp-\\r\\ntography [37], Local Area Networks [67], and new routing\\r\\ndemands [40] (it garnered the name “ARPA Internet” [93] in\\r\\nsome official documentation). The Arpanet also served as a\\r\\ntemplate for other networks [120]. The NSFNET Before Privatization (1986-1990): A wave of\\r\\nautomation hit network monitoring with the spread of Sim-\\r\\nple  Network Management Protocol (SNMP)  and Hewlett-\\r\\nPackard’s first Network Node Manager (NNM), HP Open-\\r\\nView, both developed from the late 1980s [25, 94]. Triggered\\r\\nby the explosion in network size, complexity, and use, SNMP-\\r\\nbased NNMs automated basic network monitoring and control\\r\\ntasks. This automation, in turn, permitted further division of\\r\\nlabor between more and less skilled analysts. This process,\\r\\nas well as ticketing systems to help organize hierarchical\\r\\nwork, became especially visible in the late 1980s [58, 61, 65]. It also permitted more automated management of heteroge-\\r\\nneous networks, with new protocols such as Asynchronous\\r\\nTransfer Mode (ATM) and Multiprotocol Label Switching\\r\\n(MPLS) now in widespread use for and between enterprise\\r\\nnetworks [80].

Due to our\\r\\nunique perspective, these field notes contain rich, longitudinal\\r\\ndescriptions of the studied SOC environment and, therefore,\\r\\nare our main source of ethnographic data. During this study, we analyzed 352 field notes where 57 of\\r\\nthe field notes are from 2019, 121 field notes are from 2020,\\r\\n131 are from 2021, and 43 are from 2022. These field notes\\r\\ncover over 1,000 hours of the analyst embedded in the SOC\\r\\nand contain observations from more than 550 SOC meetings. A.3  Semi-Structured Interviews\\r\\nOur   interviews   intend   to   validate   or   invalidate   our\\r\\nthemes/findings resulting from the Grounded Theory Method\\r\\n(GTM). When interviewing, we used a list of questions as a\\r\\nguide and did not ask each question in order nor did we cover\\r\\nall of them in each interview depending on the time. Table 8 captures our list of questions. Prior to starting the\\r\\ninterview, we forwarded the questions to each interviewee and\\r\\nclarified that they may either interview live (face-to-face) or\\r\\nwrite their answers. Upon interviewing, we reiterated that each\\r\\nquestion is voluntary. Furthermore, we did not record video\\r\\nor audio rather the interviewer (our fieldworker) took notes\\r\\nand typed participants’ quotes during the interview process. When an employee asked for something to be removed or not\\r\\nexplicitly stated, the interviewer removed or stopped writing\\r\\nand continued when instructed to do thus. Since the SOC we studied is short staffed, and with the\\r\\nincreased pressure from multiple facets, the lack of resources\\r\\nprevents this SOC (at times) from covering their daily oper-\\r\\nations, troubleshooting unique cases, learning new tools in\\r\\nlight of WFH, and proactively preventing new attacks.

RoundsSemi-Structured Interview Questions\\r\\nFirstRound\\r\\nSecondRound\\r\\n1.How do you feel about the level of work since COVID-19 started? When WFH started? 2.Has your level of responsibility increased, decreased, or stayed the same? 3.How is the communication amongst the team? With other departments? 4.Have priorities shifted since WFH? How so? If priorities have shifted, did it make sense as to why this occurred? 5.How has productivity been since WFH happened? Based on the current environment, what change might help improve your productivity? 6.Do the current tools support WFH? Would a certain feature provide more help? 7.What would you say is the big weakness of the SOC with WFH? How do you think this should be addressed? 1.One of the priorities during the initial transition to WFH was endpoint management (i.e., leveraging [organization’s tool] to apply better \\r\\nsecurity policies). What initially motivated this change? After altering the policies within [organization’s tool], are you content with this \\r\\nimplementation? 2.Previously, most of these machines were behind the campus firewall, now a lot of them are on external networks. Have you evaluated the \\r\\nexposure due to the remote management systems? For instance, the new [organization’s tool] system is opening up hosts quite a bit so that \\r\\nIT staff can connect to these hosts. 3.With the shifts to remotely manage devices, has accountability been considered? Specifically, who has access to and management privilege \\r\\non these remote machines? A few management accounts with admin privileges are shared by IT staff. 4.Another transition I noticed was an increased discussion of data loss prevention techniques and how those can be implemented by the \\r\\ncurrent solutions and services. Was this similarly motivated with endpoint management? Table 8: Semi-Structured interview questions – We conducted two rounds of semi-structured interviews within our SOC. During\\r\\nthe first round, we focused on analysts’ perceptions; whereas, the second round revolved around themes obtained through
