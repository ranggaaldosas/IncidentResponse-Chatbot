ABSTRACT\r\nIncident Response Planning (IRP1) is essential for effective\r\ncybersecurity  management,  requiring  detailed  documentation\r\n(orplaybooks)  to  guide  security  personnel  during  incidents. Yet,  creating  comprehensive  IRPs  is  often  hindered  by  chal-\r\nlenges  such  as  complex  systems,  high  turnover  rates,  and\r\nlegacy technologies lacking documentation. This paper argues\r\nthat,  despite  these  obstacles,  the  development,  review,  and\r\nrefinement of IRPs can be significantly enhanced through the\r\nutilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. By  leveraging  LLMs  for  tasks  such  as  drafting  initial  plans,\r\nsuggesting best practices, and identifying documentation gaps,\r\norganizations can overcome resource constraints and improve\r\ntheir  readiness  for  cybersecurity  incidents. We  discuss  the\r\npotential  of  LLMs  to  streamline  IRP  processes,  while  also\r\nconsidering the limitations and the need for human oversight in\r\nensuring the accuracy and relevance of generated content. Our\r\nfindings contribute to the cybersecurity field by demonstrating\r\na  novel  approach  to  enhancing  IRP  with  AI  technologies,\r\noffering practical insights for organizations seeking to bolster\r\ntheir incident response capabilities. II. INTRODUCTION\r\nIn an era where digital threats evolve with increasing sophis-\r\ntication, the need for robust (cybersecurity) Incident Response\r\nPlans  (IRPs)  and  appropriate  Standard  Operating  Procedures\r\n(SOPs) has never been more critical. Incident Response Plans\r\nare the broad outline of what an organization may need to do\r\nto recover from various failures such as a malware infestation. An  SOP  is  a  guide  to  the  actual  steps  needed  to  achieve\r\ncertain  outcomes  for  the  given  organization  (e.g.,  secure  an\r\naccount,  isolate  equipment  from  the  network).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"YOWdiqF/TH8BlHHwcAAlefSk1pG37sQ1sAghOgdNJvc="},"a33ded67-13df-40a4-820b-5eed745d0f03":{"id_":"a33ded67-13df-40a4-820b-5eed745d0f03","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf","file_name":"Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf","file_name":"Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf"},"hash":"fGTARv5xgyaC9h6l5cjSLcSxNWoGgUrEV/pBFAE7+TQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f62d88b9-30fc-42c0-ada5-ff431df639d7","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf","file_name":"Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf"},"hash":"YOWdiqF/TH8BlHHwcAAlefSk1pG37sQ1sAghOgdNJvc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"02412a13-5443-4076-8bea-483dab2f9f1f","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf","file_name":"Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf"},"hash":"iOM9zvN2Aa4fRqGyfcrpoIv7NcAjuhFqyAHpD+in2hM="}},"text":"The  NIST\r\nContingency Planning Guide and the Computer Security Inci-\r\ndent Handling Guide [5] [1] provide foundational frameworks\r\nfor addressing cyber incidents, emphasizing the necessity for\r\nsecurity  teams  to  be  well-prepared  to  mitigate  and  recover\r\nfrom  attacks.

The recovery process involves\r\nrestoring  systems  or  devices  to  their  normal  functions\r\nand  monitoring  to  ensure  the  incident  has  been  fully\r\nresolved [1]. 4)Post-Incident Activity:Conduct  a  post-incident  review\r\nto learn from the incident, prevent future occurrences, and\r\nimprove  the  organization’s  incident  response  capability.

If any\r\nof  the  conditions  in  that  conjunction  become  false,  then  the\r\nIRP instructions become worse-than-useless because they are\r\nnow misleading rather than just missing.

Simplistic IRP-SOP Relationship\r\nAn IRP is typically a larger-scale undertaking which includes\r\nmanagement and is often built with input from across depart-\r\nments. The  disconnect  happens  in  the  area  where  high-level\r\nIRP directions (“disconnect the computer from the network”)\r\nmeet real-world application (“log into tool X with an account\r\nhaving  security-controller  rights,  find  the  device  in  question,\r\nright-click [...]”). It  is  not  uncommon  for  companies  to  either  a)  not  have\r\nSOPs at all or b) for them to be out of date. In these scenarios,\r\nthere  is  an  implicit  trust  that  the  current  staff  will  be  able\r\nto  handle  whatever  challenges  come  their  way. This  is  often\r\nthe  case,  but  in  situations  of  high-stress  such  as  an  incident\r\nresponse event, time is usually a factor and optimizing for the\r\ncorrect execution is critical.

Some  of\r\nthese insights may be directly actionable, while others might\r\nbe  disregarded  based  on  their  applicability  to  the  specific\r\ncontext. 1)  Effective Context Setting:\r\n•Contextualizing  Prompts:To  achieve  more  targeted  out-puts from LLMs, it is essential to contextualize prompts\r\neffectively.

To mitigate or eliminate bike-shedding in incident response\r\nplanning  and  ensure  that  the  work  remains  of  high  value\r\nand  relevance,  LLMs  can  assist  by  prioritizing  through  gap\r\nanalysis. Specifically,  an  LLM  can  analyze  a  list  of  existing\r\nSOPs alongside names of forthcoming candidate SOPs to help\r\nidentify  those  of  the  highest  value  in  the  near  term. This\r\nassessment is not limited to a technical perspective but extends\r\nto  regulatory  and  compliance  considerations  as  well.

By  integrating  LLMs  into  the  process  of  developing  and\r\nmaintaining IRPs and SOPs, organizations can ensure that their\r\nincident response planning is not only relevant and compliant\r\nbut also adaptable to the evolving cybersecurity landscape. E. Time-bound\r\nThe cybersecurity landscape ever changing, and new threats\r\nand  vulnerabilities  are  constant  as  are  techniques  and  tactics\r\nused  by  threat  actors. In  this  context,  the  swift  identification\r\nand  development  of  IRPs  and  SOPs  for  new  scenarios  and\r\nnew technologies is absolutely critical. Strong SOPs should be\r\nbroadly applicable and reusable, but as unexpected responses\r\nare  needed,  an  SOP  supported  by  deep  analysis  should  be\r\nwritten  (e.g.,  an  SOP  for  disconnecting  a  campus  from  the\r\nInternet). This  section  explores  the  criticality  of  setting  and\r\nadhering to time-bound objectives in crafting IRPs and SOPs,\r\nwith a focus on leveraging LLMs to streamline this process. 1)  Setting  Realistic  Timelines:A  thorough  assessment  of\r\nan  organization’s  existing  incident  response  capabilities  and\r\nresources  lays  the  groundwork  for  realistic  timeline  setting. Understanding the starting point is essential for accurate plan-\r\nning and expectation management.

This helps identify antecedent tasks that may\r\nbe needed before those under consideration can be built. LLMs  can  dramatically  reduce  the  time  required  to  draft\r\ncomprehensive  IRPs  and  SOPs. By  inputting  organizational\r\nspecifics  and  compliance  requirements,  LLMs  can  generate\r\ninitial  drafts  that  teams  can  refine,  significantly  accelerating\r\nthe development process. 2)  Incorporating Time-bound Goals into IRP/SOP Develop-\r\nment:Establishing specific milestones within the IRP and SOP\r\ndevelopment  process  is  crucial. For  instance,  completing  the\r\ndraft of an IRP within four weeks or finalizing a set of SOPs by\r\nthe end of the quarter provides clear targets for the team to aim\r\nfor. Furthermore, allocating time for feedback and revisions is\r\nessential for an iterative approach aiming to optimize the plan. Setting clear deadlines for each review phase ensures that the\r\ndevelopment  process  remains  on  track,  allowing  for  iterative\r\nimprovements without derailing the overall timeline. The unexpected can occur in the security space, which may\r\nnegatively impact the timeline. To reduce the risk of missing\r\na deadline due to unplanned higher-priority tasks, scheduling\r\nregular  progress  reviews  helps  monitor  the  advancement  of\r\nIRP  and  SOP  development  against  the  established  timeline.

Arguably, those who can learn from \r\nsecurity incidents and address the underlying causes will reduce the prevalence of similar ones in the \r\nfuture. This research provides a new examination of how organisations learn from incidents by systemat- \r\nically reviewing academic research on organisational learning from cyber security incidents and identify- \r\ning further research needed in this area. To do this, it considers three research questions: what research \r\nhas been conducted on learning from cyber security incidents, what learning practices in organisations \r\nhave been found by research and what improvements have been recommended, and what further re- \r\nsearch is needed as organisations learn from such incidents. Using the PRISMA method, a total of 3,986 \r\narticles were extracted and, from these, a relevant set of 30 were selected for analysis to map the body of \r\nresearch, and to identify future research avenues. Despite learning lessons being recommended by both \r\nresearchers and industry standards, our findings suggest that this advice is not being fully adopted by \r\norganisations. Importantly, these studies have found inadequate participation in learning activities, with \r\nsuperficial causal investigations, scarce effort on ensuring lessons are implemented and no evaluation of \r\nwhether the actions taken actually reduce future security incidents. More research is needed to under- \r\nstand the right level and which learning practices to invest in for the greatest impact. For practitioners, \r\nthis review discusses the essential elements of an effective process to learn from incidents.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"TbV1hlUaq/PH4G3EoSvQ0DQveCJ39J/Fl0xfql/m19A="},"bef17a02-9a21-4a0c-8a00-55a392ebe012":{"id_":"bef17a02-9a21-4a0c-8a00-55a392ebe012","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"/gxIeHIrAsiJGhtH3ma7k11UbJrn/CPStDKIax1GoaM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a74a9fff-494e-4468-bab1-aae7e4219a4b","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"TbV1hlUaq/PH4G3EoSvQ0DQveCJ39J/Fl0xfql/m19A="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a91edb6c-bbbd-4340-a6d1-1d9e71c1ba56","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"QDx3wKSuOYqbq66BuqHJZN8Xe/okXfDACyNCwavGMFg="}},"text":"For practitioners, \r\nthis review discusses the essential elements of an effective process to learn from incidents.

Introduction \r\nThe rapid digitalisation of our society has created complex webs \r\nof interwoven and interdependent systems across commerce, ed- \r\nucation, health and governments ( World Economic Forum, 2022 ). Recent headlines about vulnerabilities in software such as Solar \r\nWinds, Kaseya and Log4j have heightened organisations’ aware- \r\nness of their dependence on suppliers and the intricate nesting \r\nof software within their systems ( Tuttle, 2022 ). These risks are in- \r\ncreasingly being exploited by financially motivated criminal enter- \r\nprises and by state-sponsored actors to leverage political influence \r\nor cause disruption ( Connolly and Wall, Nov. 2019 ). Despite an ex- \r\npected spend of $170 billion on investment in security and risk \r\nmanagement in 2022 ( Moore, Oct. 13, 2022 ), the number and im- \r\npact of incidents continues to grow. Statistics on the rate of inci- \r\ndents are fraught with challenges around definitions and most re- \r\n∗Corresponding author. E-mail address: cmp54@kent.ac.uk (C.M.

However, in one of the few independent reports, the UK \r\ngovernment’s 2022 survey of 1200 businesses and charities found \r\naround half had experienced at least one cyber security incident in \r\nthe past year (72% if phishing incidents are included) (NCSC, 2022) . Unfortunately, it is essential for today’s organisations to ac- \r\nknowledge that incidents will occur, and they need to be pre- \r\npared to respond and then learn from them. In addition to the \r\nrise in incidents, many organisations now face more security regu- \r\nlations, higher consumer expectations and new reporting require- \r\nments related to data privacy and infrastructure resilience.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"VEK6foVVIgl8zbhXc95LXb/bdp2ZFQReqQD6irOqVIw="},"a91edb6c-bbbd-4340-a6d1-1d9e71c1ba56":{"id_":"a91edb6c-bbbd-4340-a6d1-1d9e71c1ba56","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"/gxIeHIrAsiJGhtH3ma7k11UbJrn/CPStDKIax1GoaM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bef17a02-9a21-4a0c-8a00-55a392ebe012","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"VEK6foVVIgl8zbhXc95LXb/bdp2ZFQReqQD6irOqVIw="}},"text":"There- \r\nfore, to address the increased incident risks they cannot just work \r\nharder particularly as many face a shortage of cyber security skills \r\n( de Zan, 2019 ).

Many studies have been conducted into organisational learning \r\nand although the literature has been summarised ( Fiol and \r\nLyles, 1985 ; Huber, 1991 ; Easterby-Smith and Lyles, 2012 ; \r\nArgote, 2013 ) there is no generally accepted definition. Argote (2013) described it as a change in the organisation’s \r\nknowledge as a function of experience. Fiol and Lyles (1985) in \r\ntheir definition of organisational learning include translating this \r\nnew knowledge into actions taken by the organisation. Argote and \r\nOphir (2017) refer to it as a process where changes are made as \r\na result of experiences. The research into general organisational \r\nlearning is vast and much of it has focused on using knowlege \r\nto improve the productivity or competitiveness of organisations \r\n(for example, Peter Senge’s popular 1990 business book The \r\nFifth Discipline: The art and practice of the learning organization \r\n( Senge, 2010 )) or, it has focused on enhancing skills and emergent \r\nteam learning ( Argote and Levine, 2017 ). Rather than an extensive \r\nreview of the theories of organisational learning in this paper, we \r\nhave sought to leverage existing models which fit our research \r\nfocus. To understand learning from cyber security incidents, we \r\nneeded to look at research into how organisations intentionally \r\nidentified and implemented lessons learned from incidents. Re- \r\nsearch into how organisations learn specifically from incidents has \r\nbeen focused in the safety discipline, with prominent studies into \r\npublic disasters such as the Deepwater Horizon Macondo oil rig, \r\nthe Challenger space shuttle and the Fukushima nuclear power \r\nplant ( Swuste et al., 2020 ). Safety has a more established field of research into learn- \r\ning from incidents with many years of research exploring how \r\nto reduce the number and impact of incidents ( Le Coze, 2013 ; \r\nJaatun et al., 2009 ). It shares many similarities with cyber se- \r\ncurity as they both seek to reduce the risk of incidents.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"h16j1fnql8nwNvCGVA93eLahGs2DdbwpwNQk3ZBbx4k="},"6334b2d3-6ec3-418a-8099-6e024b18b678":{"id_":"6334b2d3-6ec3-418a-8099-6e024b18b678","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"OGB+1FwZ5s9aIu5Pp/JkAAjexxmWlIxEL5QKaDyrSSk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8faf78ea-c737-49e6-aaeb-0e10c59e4217","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"h16j1fnql8nwNvCGVA93eLahGs2DdbwpwNQk3ZBbx4k="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"eb5f7b39-ee1e-46af-921e-d33a61663bce","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"+gmuNWXK6B0blWVmdPMv8k4dyaM4E6pSJ7UXRFnNqrs="}},"text":"Evans \r\net al. ( Evans et al., 2019 ) recognised the value of applying the \r\ntechniques developed in the safety field to understand human \r\nreliability causes of safety incidents applied to security inci- \r\ndents. Similarly, other authors ( Kaur et al., 2021 ; Murphy et al., \r\n2021 ; Brostoff and Sasse, 2001 ) have commented that cyber se- \r\ncurity can learn from safety science research particularly in how \r\nto address human causes of incidents. There is an opportunity \r\nto borrow concepts from research on learning from safety inci- \r\ndents to advance the field of cyber security ( Line and Albrecht- \r\nsen, 2016 ). Murphy et al. (2021) defined three interconnected \r\nforms of learning from incidents, firstly at the individual level and \r\nthen at both the formal and informal organisational learning lev- \r\nels. Schilling and Kluge (2009) also modelled learning at distinct \r\nlevels, from the individual to organisational level. Individual learn- \r\ning is part of the process, but for an organisation to learn, it needs \r\nto go beyond and include shared knowledge interpreted in an or- \r\nganisational way ( Curado, 2006 ). This systematic literature review (SLR) will focus on formal \r\nlearning at the organisational level from cyber security incidents, \r\nas our focus is on the changes to systems, procedures and technol- \r\nogy as a result of an incident. This review exclusively covers cyber \r\nsecurity incidents, rather than generic IT incidents such as hard- \r\nware failures and performance issues. The objective is to help or- \r\nganisations improve their overall security posture by understand- \r\ning and addressing the complex causes of incidents. Therefore, this \r\nreview analyses how organisations learn post-incident rather than \r\nlearning in real time during incident response. For transparency, it \r\nexcludes; operational technology, including industrial control sys- \r\ntems or home devices, digital forensics techniques and national se- \r\ncurity or warfare. Shedden et al. (2010) reviewed the literature available in 2010 \r\nto understand how organisational learning research could be ap- \r\nplied to security incident response. At the time there had been \r\nscant research into how organisations learn from cyber security \r\nincidents.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"hbnOB/ljkxg61E/gNnNgijdZqRtieIfHV4YwPsvsAUM="},"eb5f7b39-ee1e-46af-921e-d33a61663bce":{"id_":"eb5f7b39-ee1e-46af-921e-d33a61663bce","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"OGB+1FwZ5s9aIu5Pp/JkAAjexxmWlIxEL5QKaDyrSSk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6334b2d3-6ec3-418a-8099-6e024b18b678","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"hbnOB/ljkxg61E/gNnNgijdZqRtieIfHV4YwPsvsAUM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ee4e00aa-a853-48d6-a7b2-b87c40e8c21e","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"y6U6JKcU8xsquHG7HOsXCfrxP1YKkArJUkle8+Xuc8Q="}},"text":"More recent literature reviews have studied the com- \r\nplete security incident management process and, whilst also par- \r\ntially covering learning briefly, they do not cover the topic in depth \r\n( Line and Albrechtsen 2016 ; Grispos et al., 2014 ; Horne et al., \r\n2020 ). In our SLR we address this gap by building upon previous \r\nresearch to provide an up-to-date overview of the literature fo- \r\ncused specifically on learning from incidents. From this analysis we \r\nidentified many areas of learning from security incidents, which \r\nremain unstudied which we used to highlight future research av- \r\nenues. This SLR presents a critical review of the academic literature \r\non learning from incidents and proposes an agenda for further re- \r\nsearch. It enables academics to explore these research gaps and \r\nit allows practitioners to consider opportunities for improvements. By contributing to the knowledge of how to improve the resilience \r\nof organisations against security incidents, this research aims to \r\nhelp reduce the security risks society faces from its dependence \r\non technology. To do this, it addresses the following research ques- \r\ntions (RQs): \r\n(1) What research has been conducted on learning from cyber \r\nsecurity incidents? (2) What learning practices in organisations have been found by \r\nresearch and what improvements have been recommended? (3) What further research is needed in organisational learning \r\nfrom incidents? The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section \r\n2 we present the research method used in this study. The results \r\noutlining existing research are detailed in Section 3 while Section \r\n4 discusses the organisational learning practices found by research \r\nand the gaps identified from our systematic search of the litera- \r\nture to explore future research opportunities and provide future \r\nresearch questions. In this section we also outline the practical im- \r\nplications of this work and the limitations. Finally, in Section 5 we \r\nconclude by summarising the insights of our work for security re- \r\nsearchers and practitioners. 2. Research method \r\n2.1.

PRISMA is now a common technique used in cyber security \r\nresearch ( Uchendu et al., 2021 ; Khan et al., 2022 ). The search terms used were refined iteratively. We began with \r\nterms which naturally link to the topic (‘security incident’ and \r\n‘learning’), then refined these search terms according to the results. This refinement was also guided by a set of gold standard papers \r\non the topic (i.e., those on our exact topic area) which were dis- \r\ncovered early on in our search. An example of a search refinement \r\nwas as follows: the term ‘learning’ returns many results related \r\nto machine learning rather than organisational learning; therefore, \r\nterms such as ‘organisational learning’ and ‘lessons learned’ were \r\nused. After this refinement process, the final search string was de- \r\nfined, which combined several critical search terms: (“security in- \r\ncident” OR “incident response” OR CSIRT 1 ) AND (“organisational \r\n1 Cyber Security Incident Response Team \r\n2","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"y6U6JKcU8xsquHG7HOsXCfrxP1YKkArJUkle8+Xuc8Q="},"77a77ed4-e970-4022-8b7b-e9b565aa9b47":{"id_":"77a77ed4-e970-4022-8b7b-e9b565aa9b47","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_3","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"3KY76ywH1ALTuqY4QTvBacXD94SEQpghUzAJiHlSwL4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9fc1cc33-25a2-4ad3-ae60-f692c211ce0d","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"AxHzPGpG4ZnAxBwwwUZTDzFRwL4v+IIp/e4sbL671Gk="}},"text":"C.M.

To present an overview of \r\nthe types of research conducted and published in this area, the se- \r\nlected articles were analysed by original publication details and by \r\nthe research methods used. To understand how researchers have \r\nassessed the learning practices for cyber security incidents, we re- \r\nviewed the foundation they used to frame their studies. To analyse which cyber security learning incident practices the \r\nstudies had covered we looked at how other researchers had de- \r\nscribed the practices of learning from incidents. We found those \r\nwhich were most relevant to learning from cyber security inci- \r\ndents were studies into learning from safety incidents ( Littlejohn \r\net al., 2017 ; ESReDA, 2015 ; Vastveit et al., 2015 ; Drupsteen et al., \r\n2013 ). These practices are also applicable to learning from cyber \r\nsecurity incidents due to the similarities between safety and secu- \r\nrity recognised by several authors ( Kaur et al., 2021 ; Cockram and \r\nLautieri, 2007 ; Kriaa et al., 2015 ; Lisova et al., 2019 ). There have been a range of models used within safety research \r\naligned to the different angles from which the topic has been stud- \r\nied ( Le Coze, 2013 ). Murphy et al. (2021) analysed learning from \r\nsafety incidents using the 3-P model of workplace learning. This \r\nhas three phases: presage, process and product. Their study was \r\nfocused on the perspective of the frontline worker. In contrast, \r\nLe Coze (2013) in his overview of research into learning from safety \r\nincidents used a broad framework covering: industry, countries na- \r\ntions, actors, intensity of event, disciplines and steps.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ISAN0XRPb/bFf8dxFFDtiUyw42pFWJ8Zc/Fo9yHeecM="},"4353fcd6-2861-48ba-a86b-9cfd998e1dac":{"id_":"4353fcd6-2861-48ba-a86b-9cfd998e1dac","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_3","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"3KY76ywH1ALTuqY4QTvBacXD94SEQpghUzAJiHlSwL4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0168d3d7-a6b1-41e5-9e9c-405041f21bfa","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"ISAN0XRPb/bFf8dxFFDtiUyw42pFWJ8Zc/Fo9yHeecM="}},"text":"It is the steps \r\nelement which is more relevant for this study as it includes the \r\nlearning activities; reporting, selection, investigation, dissemination \r\nand prevention.

Lukic et al. (2012) also developed a framework for learning \r\nfrom safety incidents based on the literature and validated the \r\nmodel at two organisations. Littlejohn et al.

They \r\nalso looked at the learning process through the context, partic- \r\nipants, type of incident and knowledge.

(2013) studies \r\nto include the end-to-end process, as these two studies provided \r\nthe most comprehensive analysis of the learning process activities \r\norganisations can perform. To provide more insight into the coverage of the research for \r\ncyber security, the interventions or actions step was split into two \r\nparts: incident response improvements and overall security im- \r\nprovements. This was to distinguish studies that only covered im- \r\nprovements to an organisation’s incident response capability, from \r\nthose which also studied how lessons led to changes in the wider \r\nsecurity posture. This created five categories; participation in the \r\nlearning process, causal analysis, incident response improvements, \r\noverall security improvements, and evaluation of the learning pro- \r\ncess. Participation in the learning process includes how the learn- \r\ning might be organised and the involvement of different areas of \r\nthe organisation. Causal analysis includes reporting incidents, cat- \r\negorising incidents and analysing the causes. Both these improve- \r\nment categories include determining and prioritising actions, allo- \r\ncating accountability, dedicating resources and tracking the actions \r\nto completion. The participation of different teams and the learn- \r\ning approach taken will impact the breadth of causes considered \r\nand the causes found will impact the improvements made. How \r\nthese are implemented can impact the security of the organisation. The final learning evaluation phase includes ensuring that actions \r\nare taken, as well as confirming that the action actually enabled \r\nthe anticipated improvement. It also evaluates how well the or- \r\nganisation is learning from incidents. Insights from this phase help \r\nan organisation to improve its learning process. A poor learning \r\nprocess would be evident through recurrence of incidents which \r\nhave similar causes or similar impacts and the organisation has not \r\nadapted its protection, detection and response capabilities. The phases of the learning process set out in Fig. 1 were used to \r\ncollect the data in Table 2 using a deductive approach to examine \r\nand describe the coverage of learning. 3.

There has been a continued \r\nlevel of interest in the topic; as illustrated in Fig. 3 . The most com- \r\nmon publication venue was the Computers & Security journal with \r\nfour studies published on the topic but, overall, there was a wide \r\nrange of venues (for example, the International Journal of Informa- \r\ntion Management and Hawaii International Conference on System \r\nSciences).

In ad- \r\ndition, few concentrated specifically on learning and the majority \r\nonly commented on the lessons learned as a small part of a wider \r\nstudy. Considering the pace of change in cyber security, there is \r\nthe need for more recent research specifically focusing on learning \r\nfrom incidents. 3.2. Research foundations \r\nTo gain insight into how researchers had designed their studies, \r\nwe analysed the foundations used to frame the research. Table 5 \r\nshows safety research was the most common foundation applied \r\nto frame existing studies. Management science was the next most \r\ncommon research foundation others made use of IT standards to \r\nstructure their research and some have applied constructs from \r\nsoftware engineering, with a few adopting psychology approaches. Both ISO/IEC 27035 and NIST 800–61 have frequently been \r\nutilised within our selected studies: ISO/IEC 27035 ( Line et al., \r\n2006 ; Line, 2013 ; Line et al., 2016 ; Jaatun et al., 2016 ; \r\nBartnes et al., 2016 ) and NIST 800–61 ( Grispos et al., 2015 ; \r\nAhmad et al., 2020 ). As they have learning as part of their end- \r\nto-end processes, this has encouraged studies to gather informa- \r\ntion on this step. For example, Grispos et al. (2015) conducted a \r\ncase study in a global Fortune 500 financial organisation in the \r\nUK, which included an exploratory set of interviews using the NIST \r\n800–61 phases as a framework to present the Security Incident \r\nResponse Criteria (SIRC), which can be employed to evaluate cyber \r\nsecurity incident response solutions. 6","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"vCLlIRTEDi94L61nB6rKdjHHEqWGo6pqaq8jdj+xJX0="},"8bf10487-493a-42df-bcae-5a73ceafdf57":{"id_":"8bf10487-493a-42df-bcae-5a73ceafdf57","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_7","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"V0DjbtG/1Z/fpQJ6BgspW54a3PBM5nZ6aUbXwPFFias="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e8a0a88e-e2f6-4ffb-8be2-5a70e23aa1f3","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"HUxRGMvrQOmNWoIWo0c704UcXFnVW0UDMALOu0KCB5E="}},"text":"C.M.

His research at the \r\ntime found that people in organisations were encouraged to learn \r\nas long as they did not question the “fundamental design, goals \r\nand activities of their organisations”, which is single-loop learning. Double-loop learning is used to understand not only the governing \r\nvariables that led to the immediate obvious consequences, but also \r\nto dig deeper to understand what factors may have contributed to \r\nor enabled the incident, see Fig. 4 . In a cyber security context, sin- \r\ngle loop learning would be indentifying the cause of an incident, \r\nsuch as an unpatched software package, and taking an action, such \r\nas to apply the patch. Double loop learning would be questioning \r\nthe governing variables which prevented the timely patching. Ad- \r\ndressing these underlying factors would reduce the likelihood of \r\nrecurring problems, such as of any software remaining unpatched \r\nin the future. The double-loop model has been applied to learning \r\nfrom incidents in studies included in our selection ( Shedden et al., \r\n2010 ; Shedden et al., 2011 ; Ahmad et al., 2012 ; Ahmad et al., \r\n2020 ). For example, Ahmad et al.’s (2012) study builds on a model \r\nfrom safety incidents Cooke (2003) and is inspired by double-loop \r\nmodel, to develop a model of a cyber security incident learning \r\nsystem. This double-loop learning theme is continued in a subsequent \r\nstudy by Ahmad et al. (2015) which uses the 4I (intuiting, in- \r\nterpreting, integrating, institutionalizing) organisational learning \r\nframework, building on work by Zietsma ( Zietsma et al., 2002 ) \r\nin management science. One of the reasons this model was se- \r\nlected was its use of double-loop learning principles enabling the \r\nchallenge of an organisations’ norms. The model has three lay- \r\ners that cover stakeholders, learning processes, and learning activ- \r\nities that embed learning within the organisation.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"IvVyeDOIO+waCDA+SztEuHF2D6M1C+5Rm31NE6QrbIs="},"3c0cee90-64ae-4462-8334-b7b36cf117e7":{"id_":"3c0cee90-64ae-4462-8334-b7b36cf117e7","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_7","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"V0DjbtG/1Z/fpQJ6BgspW54a3PBM5nZ6aUbXwPFFias="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9653aeee-65c9-4d69-aade-66ae5c7fc043","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"IvVyeDOIO+waCDA+SztEuHF2D6M1C+5Rm31NE6QrbIs="}},"text":"This attempts \r\nto explain how learning can happen within an organisational con- \r\ntext.

The models of double-loop learning have been rec- \r\nommended by cyber security researchers ( Shedden et al., 2010 ; \r\nShedden et al., 2011 ; Ahmad et al., 2012 ; Ahmad et al., 2020 ), \r\nyet the models themselves give little guidance to practitioners \r\nin how to move an organisation towards this type of learning.

REWI categorised the attributes needed for resiliency against inci- \r\ndents as risk awareness, response capacity and support (technical, \r\nhuman and organisational).

(2014b) conducted two studies with students, the first \r\ntraining them in GSN techniques and asking them to evaluate it. The second asked students to map the causes of a simplified inci- \r\ndent using the GSN template to build a safety case. GSN was then \r\ntrialled at a Chinese healthcare provider ( He et al., 2014a ; He and \r\nJohnson, 2017 ). Feedback was mixed; while they found it could be \r\na valuable template for some groups such as those within the in- \r\ncident response team, it had some limitations for use with a wider \r\naudience.

Others have borrowed the Agile approach from software engi- \r\nneering ( Grispos et al., 2014 ; Grispos et al., 2017 ; He et al., 2022 ). The Manifesto for Agile Software Development has gained popu- \r\nlarity in the development of software products ( Beck et al., 2001 ). Grispos et al.

(2017) applied four needs assess- \r\nment categories: Organisation, Team, Individual and Instruments, \r\nas a tool to understand the skills CSIRTs needed. They found \r\norganisational learning from incidents needed to be improved \r\nand recommended improving performance by implementing a \r\nlessons learnt procedure. Tatu et al.

The lack of consensus on a framework for researching learning \r\npractices results in inconsistent approaches to describing the learn- \r\ning expected or found by researchers, as can be seen in Table 6 . 3.4.

Ahmad et al. (2015) emphasised the chance to learn about \r\ncritical assets, technology risks and the causal structures of se- \r\ncurity incidents from a wider selection of incidents. These ma- \r\njor incident reviews were also restricted to those directly involved \r\nwith the specific incident ( Jaatun et al., 2009 ; Ahmad et al., 2012 ; \r\nAhmad et al., 2015 ; Grispos et al., 2017 ). For example, Ahmad et al. ( Ahmad et al., 2012 ; Ahmad et al., 2015 ) found only the technical \r\nteams were involved in the post-incident learning, which may re- \r\nstrict the identification of underlying causes to those of a technical \r\nnature. Grispos et al. ( Grispos et al., 2017 ) recognised the limita- \r\ntion of the incident response team not developing actions on the \r\nlessons learnt for areas outside their responsibility. Bartnes et al. ( Bartnes et al., 2016 ) suggested that organisations should consider \r\nthe use of trained facilitators to help the effectiveness of looking \r\nback to identify lessons from an incident although how this may \r\nhelp has yet to be studied. Furthermore, the researchers found that the identified lessons \r\nwere not shared beyond incident teams ( Jaatun et al., 2009 ; \r\nAhmad et al., 2012 ; Ahmad et al., 2015 ; Grispos et al., 2017 ). Line et al. (2006) emphasises the importance that lessons from \r\nincidents are shared with all parts of the organisation includ- \r\ning management, suppliers and employees. There were some ex- \r\nceptions where the lessons were shared. He and Johnson (2017) \r\nfound the healthcare provider they studied held informal meet- \r\nings to share the lessons learned with different stakeholders.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"UGq40VjWMsDrdT9VT2nJHGXWZnW0ma+m/Pay0WgAfnU="},"0ca7f749-aa1f-4e5a-9c77-91352b29d3d5":{"id_":"0ca7f749-aa1f-4e5a-9c77-91352b29d3d5","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_9","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"uP5lNMDapoRaQw4lMo21wZi7FcomjnlTWWlVmillDR8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3ca850aa-6cee-4bde-8a22-78474659f068","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"UGq40VjWMsDrdT9VT2nJHGXWZnW0ma+m/Pay0WgAfnU="}},"text":"Baskerville et al.’s (2014) case study of three organisations (rail, \r\npostal, and military) found the postal organisation also began shar- \r\ning more incident data with its competitors following a serious in- \r\ncident.

Bartnes et al. (2016) highlighted minor incidents could be \r\na source of lessons for organisations and recommended they ex- \r\nplore double-loop learning when they do experience even minor \r\nincidents. The benefits of analysing minor incidents was not stud- \r\nied. In a study by Shedden et al. (2011) , informal learning within \r\nCSIRTs is explored through a focus group of five security profes- \r\nsionals. They saw an opportunity for organisations to embrace both \r\nformal and informal learning as these two learning approaches re- \r\ninforce each other. While it encourages organisations to leverage \r\ntheir informal learning capability, this paper does not provide spe- \r\ncific details on how to enable it. 3.5. Causal analysis \r\nThis part of the learning process from incidents received the \r\nmost attention from researchers. In several studies, respondents \r\nsupported the need for learning, but researchers found little ev- \r\nidence of thorough investigations to find the underlying causes \r\n( Jaatun et al., 2009 ; Ahmad et al., 2012 ). Grispos et al. (2015) found \r\nseven out of ten respondents said root cause analysis was per- \r\nformed post-incident and all ten saw an opportunity to improve \r\nsecurity measures using post-incident analysis. Shedden et al. (2010) found most research on incident response \r\nhad been technically focused and there was an opportunity to ap- \r\nply double-loop learning principles to identify underlying causes \r\nwhich could be addressed to strengthen incident response and the \r\nsecurity of organisations. Baskerville et al. (2014) found that in one \r\nof the three companies studied, double-loop learning was applied \r\nafter serious incidents, although there are few details on this in \r\nthe article. In a more recent study, Ahmad et al.

Learning practices \r\nWhilst it is generally agreed that organisations would bene- \r\nfit from improving how they learn from incidents, there is less \r\nconsensus on how best to achieve this or what is good practice. There is a lack of consensus on a consistent model and a com- \r\nmon nomenclature to describe learning, which slows the sharing \r\nof ideas and the propagation of good practice. This is not unusual \r\nfor a relatively new field of research such as cyber security and \r\neven in established fields such as management science, the use of \r\nmodels evolves over time ( Piazza and Abrahamson, 2020 ). How- \r\never, without any coalescing around a shared view of how to assess \r\nlearning from incidents, the progress of both academic research \r\nand the adoption by practitioners will be slower. There are opportunities to expand the research on learning \r\npractices to more industries and countries. In particular, research \r\nin less regulated and process-orientated organisations is needed, \r\nas the current literature has predominantly focused on the en- \r\nergy, finance and healthcare sectors. For instance, the public sec- \r\ntor, technology and critical national infrastructure, where the im- \r\npact of incidents could be significant, are important to study. Tøndel et al. (2014) also recommended collecting data from more \r\norganisations and studying them over a longer time frame. Future research questions: \r\n•What learning from incident practices are the most commonly used? •How do organisations in the public sector / technology sector / critical\r\n national infrastructure sector learn from incidents? 4.2. Evaluating the learning capability \r\nThere has been little attention to-date on how organisations \r\nexamine how effective they are at learning.

However, we are not aware of any studies yet to assess if these \r\napproaches would also apply to how cyber security teams can im- \r\nprove their learning from cyber security incidents. To fully under- \r\nstand this, future research needs to assess whether the measures \r\nimplemented due to lessons from incidents actually reduce the \r\nprevalence of future incidents. In the selected studies, none reported an attempt to measure \r\nhow learning from incidents improved security or reported the or- \r\nganisations studied evaluated their own ability to learn. Granted \r\nas already mentioned, it is difficult to robustly measure incidents, \r\nbut much of the research conducted is based on an implicit as- \r\nsumption that learning from incidents is positive without seeking \r\nexplicit evidence to confirm this view. Researchers found that post- \r\nincident reviews are typically only conducted on major incidents \r\nand not necessarily those with the greatest learning opportunities \r\nor time invested in learning from systemic causes ( Ahmad et al., \r\n2015 ; Bartnes et al., 2016 ). Few studies acknowledge the dilem- \r\nmas faced by organisations in taking the time and resources to \r\ninvest in learning. Ahmad et al. (2015) suggested that further re- \r\nsearch is needed on the competing priorities of security manage- \r\nment and incident response teams to understand how these can \r\nbe balanced to maximise the security of an organisation’s technol- \r\nogy. Whilst researchers have urged organisations to not only focus \r\non high impact incidents and have wider participation, more re- \r\nsearch is needed to understand the sweet-spot where investment \r\nin learning activities is outweighed by the benefits. This could be \r\nstudied by comparing organisations or divisions within organisa- \r\ntions which have invested different amount of time in learning ac- \r\ntivities and assessing the impact on the prevalence of incidents. However, the ability to make comparisons would need each organ- \r\nisation to be facing a similar volume of incidents as a baseline. However, using data to measure the efficacy of learning in re- \r\nducing the number of future incidents is extremely difficult due \r\nto the lack of independent or reliable sources of incident data \r\nreadily available to academic researchers ( Salane and Jay, 2011 ).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Fzm/78hksChcXL6qi2Il9TLexCfrQHV5WdyDUUj0gXI="},"35c4e2ab-bf8e-47e4-88ad-2762ab7abc3d":{"id_":"35c4e2ab-bf8e-47e4-88ad-2762ab7abc3d","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_11","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"8DgbeP8bZ5oi2PH+Wsyx6eKTZzwmyovKQKL68ydSTvE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a14f304a-479e-4931-93b9-4a6b08cdbd47","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"Fzm/78hksChcXL6qi2Il9TLexCfrQHV5WdyDUUj0gXI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4cdcf21c-27c3-40e0-b7f8-db926a826e89","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"uPV5wxFN00eyg+AAwI0A3yIXsa4Y9iQSJoMg97atu08="}},"text":"As Ryan and Jefferson (2003) concluded “In the information se- \r\ncurity arena, there is no reliable data upon which to base deci- \r\nsions.

Measuring the impact is \r\na challenge, but perhaps future studies could explore whether the \r\ninvestment in learning led to fewer significant incidents within an \r\norganisation based on their own incident metrics on frequency and \r\nimpact, as well as other performance indicators such as time to re- \r\nstore. Another option would be an exploration of repeat incidents \r\nor recurrent types of causes which could indicate improvements \r\nwere needed to the learning process (for example, several inci- \r\ndents attributed to vulnerabilities being introduced through inse- \r\ncure coding practices). Furthermore, research could be expanded \r\nto study the perspective of other stakeholders in the organisation, \r\nsuch as audit and risk committees, business leaders, boards, and \r\nregulators. Organisations need to balance the effort between learning \r\nfrom incidents with responding to them.

Unlike safety’s review of High Reliability Organisations \r\n(HRO), to understand how some high risk organisations manage to \r\nmaintain a low level of safety incidents ( la Porte, 1996 ), remarkably \r\nthere appears to be scant research into organisations which learn \r\nfrom cyber incidents and adapt well. Ahmad et al., (2020) sug- \r\ngested the use of their conceptual framework to study cyber se- \r\ncurity in HROs. Future research questions: \r\n•What are the optimal governance structures to enable decision- making\r\n and accountability for implementing lessons learned? •How does culture impact the ability of an organisation to learn from\r\n incidents? •What are the barriers that prevent organisations learning from incidents\r\n and how might these be overcome? •When compared, what enables some organisations / some in- dustries\r\n to be more effective at learning from incidents than others? 4.6. Practical implications \r\nResearchers have found little evidence of organisational learn- \r\ning beyond the incident management team improving their pro- \r\ncesses. The incident management industry standards intentionally \r\nallow organisations the flexibility to determine how to implement \r\nthem and they are centred on incident management rather than \r\nhow lessons could improve the overall security posture of an or- \r\nganisation. However, if incident management teams do not take \r\naccountability for learning from incidents they can find themselves \r\noverwhelmed with an increasing number of incidents with ris- \r\ning severity, as the underlying causes are not being addressed \r\n( Gonzalez, 2005 ). In contrast to safety science, how organisations \r\nlearn to learn from cyber security incidents or the barriers to such \r\nlearning has not been explicitly studied. It is evident more research \r\nin this area would be valuable. Most of the publications analysed have advocated for a more \r\nthorough causal analysis to identify the underlying causes. This is \r\neven more important in today’s complex and entwined IT systems \r\nwithin the context of an organisation and their IT providers.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"poytnEUhahMaxC5GZbJHo+6ihKYDyz0LlT1t0Tkdxd4="},"72105511-15af-4e1e-be62-5fd0614f9f53":{"id_":"72105511-15af-4e1e-be62-5fd0614f9f53","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_13","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"OB1lvMj77c0asdqY1GEiALkXk19315bsG9nadHaEIuw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ee39b0db-5377-4b6e-9b53-7f200c03f05f","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"poytnEUhahMaxC5GZbJHo+6ihKYDyz0LlT1t0Tkdxd4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"01074a5a-7ea5-49ee-bb30-9b16298e020d","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"EHV0DElqcqHodR8yAiFlxvIKhsqpH9Jt/XB0OZF1cFE="}},"text":"Or- \r\nganisations need to consider the social aspects of incident inves- \r\ntigations and how to facilitate the most beneficial causal analysis \r\n( Tavris and Aronson, 2020 ; Edmondson, 2018 ). There is a risk or- \r\nganisations assemble a team of people involved in a specific inci- \r\ndent and unintentional hindsight bias leads them to miss critical \r\ncontributory factors ( Cook, 1998 ). Security practitioners can start \r\nby evaluating how well their organisation has been learning from \r\nincidents using the process outlined in Fig. 1 . This will enable them \r\nto consider; if the right people are involved (as this impacts the \r\npotential lessons learned), how well systematic causes are iden- \r\ntified and addressed, and then assess if this helps to reduce the \r\nprevalence of incidents. 4.7. Limitations \r\nThis study focused on learning from cyber security incidents. It is possible research in other fields of technology, safety, natu- \r\nral disasters and other types of incidents could offer additional in- \r\nsights. Whilst steps were taken to ensure all relevant papers within \r\nthe cyber security domain were identified, there remains a pos- \r\nsibility some were missed due to the reliance on search strings, \r\nthe indexing, categorisation, and search capabilities of the online \r\ndatabases. We only included articles written in English for which \r\nthe full text was accessible, which resulted in 11 papers being ex- \r\ncluded. Therefore, there is a risk some conclusions about the re- \r\nsearch in this area were missed. However, considering the number \r\nof studies reviewed and the similarity of findings, it is assumed \r\nthis had a minimal impact on our assertions. 5. Conclusion \r\nSecurity incidents pose a huge threat to society. There is more \r\ndata than ever before, and the complex web of systems and suppli- \r\ners means we are more vulnerable to incidents. The standards used \r\nby practitioners recommend learning from incidents, but these \r\ndocuments do not provide much guidance on how to do this well. Yet there has been relatively few studies on this topic in cyber se- \r\ncurity. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and research agenda \r\nhave structured the existing research into how organisations learn \r\nfrom cyber security incidents and suggested where future research \r\nis needed to propel the field forward.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"jkqgP8bH6iBWv2RCAX9Ejzry1TJU2s141YKQh110EaA="},"01074a5a-7ea5-49ee-bb30-9b16298e020d":{"id_":"01074a5a-7ea5-49ee-bb30-9b16298e020d","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_13","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"OB1lvMj77c0asdqY1GEiALkXk19315bsG9nadHaEIuw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"72105511-15af-4e1e-be62-5fd0614f9f53","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"jkqgP8bH6iBWv2RCAX9Ejzry1TJU2s141YKQh110EaA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"55b98141-9543-4d56-8822-6ea917d46c9e","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"rgZKL9W7JuUV2JFf7FBQ//ovG6R0OQsoXjX9vH4DFT8="}},"text":"By providing an overview \r\nof the topic, we hope the analysis of the literature will serve as a \r\nvaluable resource for those researchers interested in exploring the \r\nfuture research opportunities highlighted. The literature has more emphasis on acquiring knowledge \r\nthrough post-incident investigations with less attention on the \r\nimplementation of the lessons. There has been no consistent \r\nmodel applied to assess how organisations learn from incidents. Those studies which have been conducted, recommend organisa- \r\ntions should improve learning from incidents with wider partici- \r\npation and sharing of post-incident reports, often suggesting us- \r\ning double-loop learning in the investigations to address systemic \r\ncauses. The research has shown organisations are not yet benefit- \r\nting as much as possible from learning from incidents and are not \r\nevaluating if their learning is effective. The analysis of the literature highlighted unanswered questions \r\nwhich were organised into a future research agenda. Fourteen re- \r\nsearch questions have been suggested and how these could be \r\nstudied discussed. Further studies are recommended to explore \r\nwhat prevents organisations from understanding the underlying \r\ncauses to identify the improvements needed and to implement \r\nthem to reduce the risk of incidents in the future. In addition, ap- \r\nproaching it from the opposite side and researching High Reliabil- \r\nity Organisations (HRO) that learn well would be beneficial. Identifying the valuable lessons within an organisation’s social \r\nand political environment requires effort. Ensuring the lessons lead \r\nto useful changes that prevent further incidents requires organisa- \r\ntions to evaluate how well they are learning. Further research is \r\nneeded to identify how organisations can invest in learning to see \r\nthe greatest benefits. By improving how organisations learn from \r\nincidents it is hoped they can reduce the likelihood and impact of \r\ncyber security incidents happening in the future. This will help to \r\nreduce the risks society faces from its dependence on IT.

INTRODUCTION \r\nProductivity  in  incident  management  worldwide  in  companies  is  scalable  and  optimizable. This \r\nproductivity according to [1], is a very important indicator that defines the quantification of the products or \r\nservices produced based on the resources used. In turn, the difference in productivity between companies is \r\nrelated to three common situations such as: i) experience and knowledge of the partners, ii) use of technologies, \r\nand iii) organizational structure. The primary goal for a business is to increase productivity and positively affect \r\nit to generate value for the product or service that is provided to the end user. Therefore, in [2], [3] the authors \r\nstate  that  automation  in  the information  technology environment  is  considered  a  foundation  for  increasing \r\nproductivity  and  quality  of  services. The  use  of technology,  is  important  to  take  advantage  of  its  rapid \r\ndevelopment by integrating the tools it provides, resulting in great benefits [4]. In the same way, by investing \r\nin and implementing ICT, companies can increase  their productivity and staff performance, while reducing \r\ncosts [5], since, is proven to provide automated student queries with an accuracy that is above 75%. On the \r\nother  hand,  in  the  technological  area,  there  are  many  relevant  advances,  for  example,  Eliza,  a  bot-based \r\nprogram  developed  in  the  late  1970s  by  MIT  professor  Joseph  Weizenbaum, [6] is  said  to  be  the  first \r\nconversational bot that can answer questions and engage in conversation depending on the words or phrases it \r\nreceives.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"wDjBz6nNUwv9hMrM/g9UJzihdfLXxoksMflCdvLcMyI="},"c8698651-22cb-4630-8411-55a12e59ecdb":{"id_":"c8698651-22cb-4630-8411-55a12e59ecdb","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"AB/VXWnviEm9ZjwO6wxS+u7M6JtCA8nB1nN5wnipvR8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"26cffc3b-f152-4d20-bf35-daebca677980","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"wDjBz6nNUwv9hMrM/g9UJzihdfLXxoksMflCdvLcMyI="}},"text":"This was the beginning of advances in the research and improvement of artificial intelligence (AI) \r\nthat   could   later   perform   jobs   effectively.

The authors, in [9] mention that, for customer management and satisfaction, \r\nthe company's activities must be addressed by a quality management system. From the point of view of information technology (IT), an incident is considered as the interruption \r\nof the services offered by a company, which can be reported by users or, on the contrary, it can be generated \r\nby  applications  in  an  automated  way [10],  In [11] it  is  stated  that  an  incident  management  system  has  the \r\npurpose  of  providing  resolutive  attention  to  the  users  within  the  shortest  possible  time  and  acts  as  an \r\ninformation center in charge of managing the monitoring, registration, and follow-up of the incidents; likewise, \r\nin [11] it  is  mentioned  that  the  purpose  of  the  implementation  of  ITIL-based  models  to  manage  incidents \r\nincreases the quality of the service, and according to [12], The status of incidents can vary between assigned \r\n(which  does  not  allow  adding  violations),  closed  (which  does  not  allow  modification)  and  open  (default or \r\ninitial status of the incident). Incidents can be related to customer service, and request processes, among others. In IT, incident management with conversational bots is of great support, since it allows streamlining processes \r\nto  meet  the  needs  of  customers  according  to  their  needs [13]. Similarly,  the  steps  involved  in  incident \r\nmanagement are  incident entry, registration, classification, diagnosis, resolution, control, and closure of the \r\nincident. Good incident management will allow companies to have better interaction with both their internal \r\nand external customers [14].","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"aTsZPshIcz0pXVtcyuS1JSKd2+IsbRftp/ee4PB0oj8="},"97dc84c5-0976-4cdf-bb81-205590bb87c8":{"id_":"97dc84c5-0976-4cdf-bb81-205590bb87c8","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"d4ISLt9r/o9vi2tnywwmj4EXWH5voAVI5kmJPE7EZz8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f85c726b-8e31-4aa8-8db5-dd317bcf1012","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"aTsZPshIcz0pXVtcyuS1JSKd2+IsbRftp/ee4PB0oj8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"6f14ef8e-da79-4492-9e81-e45e314b9913","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"8IqcVF2V8bwcuMCwPaQFCgwL+8CuMNyB1XGEqYp1EfQ="}},"text":"The use of chatbots allows to solve the problems that the user might currently have, besides being a \r\nbeneficial tool in customer service, it can reduce up to 30% of care costs [15], however, it is normal to find that \r\nit most important use is in entertainment and as a complementary messaging software; it is also frequently used \r\nas  a  virtual  assistant  on  websites,  highlighting  that  this  can  be  the  subject  of  research  for  larger  purposes.

REVIEW OF RELATED WORK \r\n2.1. Bots in software engineering \r\nIn [16], the authors relate chatbots in software engineering. The scope of bots in software engineering \r\nand their application is broad, as it is considered that bots should be analyzed to provide a general picture of \r\nwhy  and  how  they  should  be  applied  in  software  engineering. Also,  they  mention  that  bots  are  more  than \r\nautomated  scripts,  but  that  they  can  become  systems  that  make  decisions;  as  in [17] where  an  artificial \r\nintelligence machine LAMBDA, tries to convince its creators that it thinks and feels after several conversations, \r\nis exposed. 2.2. Bots in the health sector \r\nIn the health sector, in [18], [19] the authors indicate that conversational interfaces (CI) have been \r\nimplemented  in  different  forms  applied  for  health  and  behavioral  intervention  purposes,  patient  self-\r\nmanagement, and clinical decision support, based on information extracted from a review of 42 funded projects, \r\n428  research  publications,  and  162  patents.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"+gZBx+z5OwHvAefndShXXCj9uR9ACmW+MOFirPZKfuQ="},"6f14ef8e-da79-4492-9e81-e45e314b9913":{"id_":"6f14ef8e-da79-4492-9e81-e45e314b9913","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"d4ISLt9r/o9vi2tnywwmj4EXWH5voAVI5kmJPE7EZz8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"97dc84c5-0976-4cdf-bb81-205590bb87c8","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"+gZBx+z5OwHvAefndShXXCj9uR9ACmW+MOFirPZKfuQ="}},"text":"Similarly,  according  to [19] the  increase  in  demand  for  mental \r\nhealth care has been driving. Also, the development of digital mental health interventions (DMHI), generated \r\nthat conversational bots are integrated into DMHI as support in diagnosis, detection, symptom management, \r\nbehavior change, and content delivery; however, only 24% of DMHI entities consider a chatbot and a small \r\nnumber of professionals have had interaction with them on this topic. In terms of solution evaluation, the authors state that the means to verify user satisfaction through the \r\nuse of conversational bots are not currently standardized. In [20] the authors describe four studies, where the \r\noverall  sample  of  141  survey  participants  (experts  and  novices)  to  define  attributes  for  interaction  quality \r\ntesting,  designed  and  piloted  a  new  scale  to  measure  satisfaction  after  an  experience  with  conversational \r\nchatbots. This arises for the diagnosis of a checklist (BOT-Check), a 15-item questionnaire (BOT Usability \r\nScale, BUS-15) with estimated reliability between 0.76 and 0.87 distributed over five factors; however, the \r\nlatter requires further validation testing. Likewise, in the AI categories, in [21] reference is made to interactive \r\nAI, which enables efficient and interactive communication automation, which is oriented to the commercial \r\nsphere.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \r\nThis section presents the bibliometric analysis and detailed analysis of previous work. The first part \r\nshows the relationships between the common terms concerning incident management with conversational bots \r\nand density visualization. The second part seeks to find the scientific gap between the manuscripts proposed in \r\nthis study to develop an architectural model that allows the implementation of a conversational bot for incident \r\nmanagement. 4.1. Bibliometric analysis \r\nVOSviewer  has  been  used,  which,  according  to [72],  is  a  research  tool  for  creating  bibliometric \r\nnetworks based on manuscripts and journals, also, it applies text mining in the creation and visualization of co-\r\noccurrence  networks  on  relevant  words. This  tool  helped  the  study  with  visual  information,  allowing  us  to \r\nvisualize the keywords associated with incident management with conversational bots. It also helped to identify \r\nthe benefits, types, and processes that optimize conversational chatbots in clusters. The VOSviewer divides the \r\nterminology into clusters according to their relevance to one another. Figure 3 represents the visualization of \r\nthe bibliometric map showing the relationships between the most used terminology and how it is linked. The \r\nlargest node represents the most used terminology in the manuscripts, and its size represents the number of \r\ntimes these words appear in the manuscripts. The analysis was performed on the title and abstract using a binary counting method of 108 keywords \r\nexamined with a minimum threshold of 2 occurrences, resulting in 28 terminologies, as shown in Figure 3.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"4w6Rc3aA4Yz/F0Wplf1nDQZR0yftmmJ9P8LPit2LKzY="},"de946c02-0fa1-4736-b719-03c8711f53d6":{"id_":"de946c02-0fa1-4736-b719-03c8711f53d6","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf_5","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"5ku7EiWrLP8yhKYzXoMeTghZzhYB5k0geKWkV3qdK24="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7b8b61da-ad94-46ff-acea-673a73533ad1","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"4w6Rc3aA4Yz/F0Wplf1nDQZR0yftmmJ9P8LPit2LKzY="}},"text":"The \r\nlargest nodes representing each cluster in the network map are determined as a cluster of “artificial intelligence” \r\n(red), a cluster of “conversational agent” (green), a cluster of “natural language processing” (violet) cluster of \r\n“ai” (blue), and, finally, cluster de “chatbot” (sky blue).

Whereas, the author [52] presented a chatbot that communicates with the \r\ncustomer in a variety of interaction styles that allows pleasant online ordering. These chatbots serve as guides \r\nin information systems, [63] features a chatbot that guides the user to perform banking transactions, while [27] \r\nhas created a chatbot that serves as a guide for visually impaired customers. It is noted that 2 authors describe \r\nconversational chatbots that are social, while 2 others present those that serve as guides. In [24] introduced  two  agents  with  a  wealth  of  voice- and  text-based  diabetes  information,  AIDA \r\nChatbot,  and  AIDA  Cookbot,  to  support  diabetes  patients,  physicians,  and  caregivers  in  text-based  dietary \r\nrecommendations  for  diabetic  patients. Similarly, [67] presented conversational  agents  using  mHealth \r\ninterventions,  to  generate  healthy  lifestyle  changes  for  audiences  with  diabetes  disease. While [39],  [47] \r\npresented  a  conversational  system  that  interacts  with  the  user  so  that  it  can  provide  more  precise \r\nrecommendations according to the user's context. In education [54] bots can be used in educational or general presentations to enhance interaction; they \r\nare  also conversation-based learning support frameworks. Whereas, [57] mentions that these conversational \r\nbots  adopt  relevant  educational  approaches  and  technology-enhanced  learning. Given such  research,  it  is \r\nreaffirmed that the application of chatbot technology is fully favorable in the educational sector.

Manuscript analysis \r\nSeven databases of manuscript results were used for the search, the number of manuscripts retrieved \r\nwas a total of six hundred and fifty-seven (657) in the initial search, and the final results with a total of forty-\r\nseven (47) manuscripts. As presented in Table 5. The initial search of manuscripts has gone through a cleaning \r\nprocess using the PRISMA methodology, where phase 1 shows the initial search, phase 2 after eliminating the \r\n15 duplicates and those that are not related to the research topic, phase 3 has 47 manuscripts that are related to \r\nthe research topic. For more detail, Figure 5 shows the number of manuscripts by databases, with Scopus with \r\n21, the source that maintained the highest number of manuscripts after the filters. Also shown is the number of \r\nmanuscripts  obtained  in  the  other  databases  such  as  Springer  5,  Willy  1,  Indices  10,  Taylor  &  Francis, \r\nEbscohost 5 and Pubmed with 3.

PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE \r\nAfter analyzing the manuscripts related to incident management with conversational bots, we have \r\nfound very customized architecture models that do not adapt to multiple realities; therefore, in this section, we \r\npropose an architecture model that adapts to different realities and contexts. The proposed architecture model \r\ncalled  (LUWI),  seeks  to  improve  incident  management  and  has  characteristics  such  as  interactivity,  semi-\r\nhuman  conversation,  informative  assistance, and novelty. This  model  has  3  modules  which  are:  Users, \r\nInteraction channels,  and  Conversational  Chatbot. These  modules  are  mutually  related  for  their  optimal \r\nfunctioning. As shown in Figure 7. In modules 1 and 2, the user communicates with the chatbot via SMS, Web Page, or E-mail. The user \r\ncan ask the conversational chatbot (CC) what he/she needs. The CC has a data input and an information output. In module 3, in the input, the CC receives data from the user, in turn, this data goes through 3 stages to give a \r\nresponse to the user. In stage 1, there is the information extraction module which contains 6 components, dialog \r\nstate tracker (DST), neural intent encoding (NIE), NLC, NLP, and neural recommender system (NRS). Where \r\nDST, NIE, NLC, and NLP are responsible for understanding what the user wants by analyzing the context of \r\nthe dialog. Then, the data is studied by the NRS which generates a recommendation that will be sent and stored \r\nin the knowledge base (KD). In stage 2, the KD of the conversational chat CC interacts with 2 components: \r\nmachine  learning (ML) and business logic (BL). The  CC evaluates the  initial extraction data  by interacting \r\nwith the ML model where the results are stored in the KD in question and answer format.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"UGRCQJrJ5x/tS4RXgNnj6Pc4FZFX+pG33Z2M/59MoI8="},"727b4821-882a-4b31-8569-c059eb53ad3b":{"id_":"727b4821-882a-4b31-8569-c059eb53ad3b","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf_10","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"BkorvKV8bKEfBdrZY31Zevaa9dYtw/cIwxTd+UK36sA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d4acce63-4adf-4fa6-b782-8e3116c8e149","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"UGRCQJrJ5x/tS4RXgNnj6Pc4FZFX+pG33Z2M/59MoI8="}},"text":"In turn, the model is \r\ntrained  to  assert  its  learning  with  the  interaction  of  many  data. Then,  the  KD  interacts  with  the  BL, i.e. it \r\nmanages the incidents through the system connected to a database focused on the first 4/8 ITIL processes which \r\nare: \r\n1. Incident registration. 2. Incident categorization. 3. Incident prioritization. 4. Incident assignment. 5. Task creation and management. 6. SLA management and escalation. 7. Incident resolution. 8. Incident closure. In stage 3, we have module 3, CRG response generator, this module has 3 components: neural policy \r\nagent  (NPA),  natural  language  generator  (NLG),  and  neural  variation  interface  network  (NVI). These \r\ncomponents  are  in  charge  of  processing  the  information  contained  in  the  knowledge  base,  where  the  NPA \r\ndetermines the type of decisión-related to the current dialogue, NLG helps to create conversational responses \r\nin the context identified in stage 1.

(Luz Obregon-Palomino) \r\n1553 \r\n6. CONCLUSION \r\nIn  this  SLR  where  research  papers  from  2019  to  2022  have  been  analyzed,  an  initial  set  of  657 \r\nmanuscripts were found, and 47 manuscripts were carefully selected based on inclusion/exclusion criteria using \r\nPRISMA methodology. This review provides the reader with insights into the benefits, types of conversational \r\nbots, and processes that improve after the use of these bots. The research questions focus on 3 main points. Firstly, we identified the benefits of conversational bots where 2/19 very important benefits were obtained such \r\nas: \"helping to obtain information\" and \"Facilitating customer service\" with a total of 6 manuscripts referring \r\nto it. Secondly, in the  types of conversational bots, a  total of 9 types of conversational bots were found, of \r\nwhich  2  are  the  most  used:  \"Conversational  agents\"  and  \"Chatbots  with  AI\". Thirdly,  3/5  processes  that \r\noptimize  conversational  bots were  found,  where  the  most prominent  ones  are:  \"Teaching  process\",  \"Health \r\nprocesses\" and \"Customer service processes\". Conversational bots can be applied in any sector, both in public \r\nentities  and  private  companies,  to  improve  their  productivity  by  streamlining  customer  service  processes, \r\npersonalized recommendations, and teaching, among others, through communicative interaction. Finally, the \r\nresults of this study will help future researchers to take as a basis the knowledge of conversational automated \r\nsystems and be able to develop them in companies to efficiently manage the incidents that may arise.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"OLgdpe81qcTd6SZcADs+1Zurq2OmtZTFFzTaLcYXJSo="},"49f79edc-6cf6-46e8-a92a-a8f10068505c":{"id_":"49f79edc-6cf6-46e8-a92a-a8f10068505c","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf_11","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"1lduv7rGX7YPqrxKZiFRcv61RsbbYzGMUhF+vd51QFI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a0023a3a-59db-4aa7-8b96-74b41c089230","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"OLgdpe81qcTd6SZcADs+1Zurq2OmtZTFFzTaLcYXJSo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b57d123c-6374-4832-85c0-aef814e2eec1","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"GXBtPRcLMZLiMy1ZQthXqUO6dCXp9LPv2+4ntneeEw0="}},"text":"In this \r\nway,  this  study  proposes  an  architecture  model  (LUWI)  that  allows  the  conversational  chatbot  to  adapt  to \r\ndifferent process environments where interactivity and communication are very relevant features accompanied \r\nby  the  personalization  of  learning  and  understanding  of  natural  language  through  ML,  focused  on  the \r\nframework of ITIL best practices to manage incidents.

Considering\r\nthe  available  information,  a  brief  description  of  the  security  threat,  ransom  amount,  and  impact  on  the\r\norganization are discussed for each incident. This review reports an increased frequency of cybersecurity threats\r\nto  the  FA  sector. To  minimize  these  cyber  risks,  popular  cybersecurity  frameworks  and  recent  agriculture-\r\nspecific  cybersecurity  solutions  are  also  discussed. Further,  the  need  for  AI  assurance  in  the  FA  sector  is\r\nexplained, and the Farmer-Centered AI (FCAI) framework is proposed.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"NzVfakFMdx2DA+xh7jSFQB7bgRXPkd5moZt7fwv+YZw="},"db5939d7-0b09-4191-b478-4fea9b2ee755":{"id_":"db5939d7-0b09-4191-b478-4fea9b2ee755","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"mAFNQhpSafNpKHErTkjO4G/3sb9L72rCPhKTPR4Lq24="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7479f149-31e7-414b-930f-ab206ab74fb9","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"NzVfakFMdx2DA+xh7jSFQB7bgRXPkd5moZt7fwv+YZw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"208ebdba-36cc-42db-bcf8-5eb027ad7438","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"laKE+f7CNxYhzsyJNppSRrA3geekj8XqtRzP4ySPS8Q="}},"text":"The main aim of the FCAI framework\r\nis  to  support  farmers  in  decision-making  for  agricultural  production,  by  incorporating  AI  assurance. Lastly,\r\nthe effects of the reported cyber incidents on other critical infrastructures, food security, and the economy are\r\nnoted, along with specifying the open issues for future development. 1    Introduction\r\nCritical infrastructures are “the assets, systems, networks, facilities, and other elements that society relies upon\r\nto  maintain  national  security,  economic  vitality,  and  public  health,  and  safety”   [1]. The  U.S. Department\r\nof  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  categorized  the  16  critical  infrastructure  sectors  as  follows:   1)  Chemical,  2)\r\nCommercial Facilities, 3) Communications, 4) Critical Manufacturing, 5) Dams, 6) Defense Industrial Base, 7)\r\nEmergency Services, 8) Energy, 9) Financial Services, 10) Food and Agriculture, 11) Government Facilities, 12)\r\nHealthcare and Public Health, 13) Information Technology, 14) Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste, 15)\r\nTransportation Systems, and 16) Water and Wastewater Systems [1]. The elements of these 16 infrastructure\r\nsectors  have  connections  and  interdependencies  [2],  and  losing  one  or  more  lifeline  functions  immediately\r\nimpacts the others. For this survey study, the focus is on the Food and Agriculture (FA) sector. In 2021, the\r\nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)[3] reported that agriculture and related industries have a 5.4% share\r\n($1.264  trillion)  of  the  U.S. Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP),  and  farms  contribute  about  0.7%  ($164.7)  of\r\nthe U.S. GDP. Additionally, the FA sector provided 10.5% (21.1 million) of the U.S. employment in 2021, and\r\nan average American household spends 12% of their household’s budget on food [3].","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"8/uAmFOsYUp9uDcaeyYyzrOxw4hUDum0BxDSAPur08I="},"208ebdba-36cc-42db-bcf8-5eb027ad7438":{"id_":"208ebdba-36cc-42db-bcf8-5eb027ad7438","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"mAFNQhpSafNpKHErTkjO4G/3sb9L72rCPhKTPR4Lq24="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"db5939d7-0b09-4191-b478-4fea9b2ee755","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"8/uAmFOsYUp9uDcaeyYyzrOxw4hUDum0BxDSAPur08I="}},"text":"Based on the Food and\r\nAgriculture  Organization  (FAO)  of  the  United  Nations  (UN),  the  global  demand  for  food  will  grow  to  70%\r\nto meet the population by 2050 [4].

It is deemed\r\npossible to increase the quantity and quality of agriculture and food products using these emerging technologies\r\nin  the  farm  management  cycle    [6]. This  new  age  of  agriculture  is  refered  to  as  Agriculture  4.0  [7]. A\r\nsmart farm is a cyber-physical system whose operations can be monitored and controlled by a computer and\r\ncommunication  system  using  a  set  of  networked  agents  [8,  9]. These  network  agents  can  be  sensors,  linear\r\nactuators,  control  processing  units,  and  communication  devices  [10]. As  noted  by  Zanella  et  al. [11],  smart\r\nfarming  utilizes  emerging  technologies,  and  due  to  their  complexity,  it  incorporates  all  the  security  problems\r\npresent in these technologies into smart farms, making them vulnerable to security threats.

For instance, DoS/DDoS attacks can halt the data transfer between a\r\nfarm and a food producer, affecting the farmer’s decision-making. Similarly, ransomware attacks can interrupt\r\ndaily agricultural operations such as mixing fertilizers and logistical operations,  or halting operations in food\r\nprocessing plants. Thus, a review of the actual cybersecurity incidents can assist in making better cyber policies,\r\nstrategies, and defense solutions across the board. Recently, Hassanzadeh et al. [31] have documented fifteen\r\nactual  cybersecurity  incidents  in  the  Water  and  Wastewater  sector.

The  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)\r\nand the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) published ISO/IEC 27000 security standards, which\r\nare  also  commonly  used  in  different  organizations  [101]. Recently,  the  U.S. Cybersecurity  and  Infrastructure\r\nSecurity Agency (CISA) [102] recommended using the MITRE’s Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, & Common\r\nKnowledge (ATT&CK) CSF to develop adversary profiles, conduct activity trend analysis, and augment reports\r\nfor detection, response, and mitigation purposes. ATT&CK has also been used by the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) for Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and modeling threats [103, 104]. Considering these\r\nreasons, NIST, CIS, ISO 27000, and ATT&CK are reported in this sub-section.

It  describes  essential  cybersecurity  outcomes  that\r\ncan  be  used  to  understand,  assess,  prioritize,  and  communicate  cybersecurity  risks  in  organizations.

Based  on  the  official  resource  [108],  the  development  of  the  benchmarks\r\nis  a  seven-step  process:  engage  the  community,  define  scope,  create  a  draft,  consensus  begins,  discuss  and\r\nadjust, consensus met, and publish CIS Benchmark. This process involves subject matter experts, technology\r\nvendors, public, private and academic community members. Every recommendation in a benchmark provides\r\na  detailed  discussion  of  profile  applicability,  description  of  the  recommendation,  rationale,  impact,  audit  of\r\nthe  recommendation,  and  remediation. The  organizations  can  select  a  suitable  benchmark  based  on  their\r\ntechnology, and additional CIS Foundation Benchmarks can be found on their official website. 3.1.3    ISO/IEC 27000 series\r\nISO/IEC  27000  series  is  a  family  of  standards  for  Information  Security  Management  Systems  (ISMS)  using\r\nwhich  organizations  can  become  risk-aware  to  identify  and  address  weaknesses  [112].

Based on the design and philosophy of ATT&CK [110],  Tactics represent\r\nthe “why” that focuses on the adversary’s technical goals, the reason for an action, and what they are trying to\r\nachieve. The Techniques answer “how” an action achieves a tactical goal, while Sub-techniques give a granular\r\ndescription of techniques. Lastly, Procedure indicates “what” an adversary did and how they used a Technique\r\nor Sub-technique. Overall, the ATT&CK framework for enterprise includes 14 tactics, 193 techniques, and 401\r\nsub-techniques. Companies such as Cisco [114], Fortnite [115], Claroty [116], and AttackIQ [117] have signified\r\nthe  importance  of  using  ATT&CK  for  CTI.

[156] developed DoS/DDoS attack detection frameworks to secure Agricultural 4.0 infrastructure. They\r\nused Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), CNN, and Deep Neural Network (DNN) – three different DL techniques\r\n– and compared their performance. For experiments, the authors used two datasets - CIC-DDoS2019 [157] and\r\nTON-IoT datasets [142] – and the performance of the models was compared based on traditional evaluation\r\nmetrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC. The authors concluded that CNN provided an accuracy\r\nof 99.95% for binary network traffic attack detection and 99.2% for multiclass network traffic attack detection,\r\noutperforming  the  other  two  DL  models. Later  in  2023,  Kethineni  and  Pradeepini  [158]  developed  a  fused\r\nCNN  model  with  a  Bi-GRU  for  detecting  DoS/DDoS  attacks. The  data  preprocessing  -  label  encoding  and\r\ndata normalization - is performed in the input layer, which gives this preprocessed data to the Bi-GRU layer. The Bi-GRU layer consists of two GRUs and the attention layer. The attention layer is vital because it helps\r\nfind  the  essential  features  to  detect  DDoS  attacks. The  output  from  the  Bi-GRU  layer  is  then  given  to  the\r\nconvolution  layer  to  extract  deeper  features  from  the  data. Lastly,  the  output  layer,  which  consists  of  the\r\nSoftMax  function,  receives  these  features  that  classify  the  regular  and  DDoS  attack  instances. The  authors\r\ntested this framework on APA-DDoS-Attack [157] and TON-IoT datasets [142], which resulted in 99.35% and\r\n99.71% accuracy in attack detection.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"4opNJuaDcz1FyVHyL6bvroZJG0/79DifL/s6jebtaYc="},"4ba5d257-a8a3-4220-a825-9cdb523b27ef":{"id_":"4ba5d257-a8a3-4220-a825-9cdb523b27ef","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_14","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"bLOw+364nGncaYR0G2daCE/yfidUOsiUwnGqJkzOQbg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3e6c9417-0ad4-490e-963a-adf3c6faba93","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"4opNJuaDcz1FyVHyL6bvroZJG0/79DifL/s6jebtaYc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a94606f2-6163-4a24-a808-dfe507c6c40e","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"vDBRY/e00lsE6bSKiWIieEYJAYJ83nUSKSielBtiqm8="}},"text":"In 2022, Privacy-encoding-based Federated Learning (PEFL) [159], and Federated Learning-based Intru-\r\nsion  Detection  System  (FELIDS)  [160]  frameworks  are  proposed  to  ensure  data  security  and  privacy  while\r\nperforming  network  attack  detection. The  PEFL  framework  has  two  levels  of  data  privacy  and  a  Federated\r\nLearning integrated GRU (FedGRU) for intrusion detection. The first privacy level is based on perturbation-\r\nbased  encoding,  responsible  for  feature  mapping  and  normalization. Next,  DL-based  LSTM  Autoencoder\r\n(LSTM-AE)  is  applied  for  data  transformation  in  the  second  privacy  level  of  the  PEFL  framework. Lastly,\r\nthis transformed data is then given to the FedGRU module, responsible for classifying normal and attack data\r\ninstances. The authors used the ToN-IoT dataset [142] for experimentation and compared performance using\r\ntraditional classification metrics with other existing Federated Learning (FL) based techniques. Based on the\r\nresults, the authors concluded that the PEFL framework improved the attack detection rate, precision, and F1\r\nscore  for  the  ToN-IoT  dataset  compared  to  the  non-FL  and  FL  techniques. For  the  FELIDS  framework,  the\r\nmotivation was to maintain data privacy via local learning, i.e., sharing the model updates with the aggregation\r\nserver without sharing the entire data. In this framework, the authors used and compared three DL classifiers\r\n-  DNN,  CNN,  and  RNN. For  experiments,  the  authors  [160]  used  three  datasets  -  CSE-CIC-IDS2018  [154],\r\nMQTTset  [161],  and  InSDN  [162]  –  and  evaluated  the  performance  using  traditional  classification  metrics. They compared the performance of FELIDS with centralized DL models and noted that FELIDS provided the\r\nhighest accuracy in detecting attacks.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"cSS2rG/zsg3EHEYBlQoOdQyyok1mLgIMZsn4JVB1zhs="},"a94606f2-6163-4a24-a808-dfe507c6c40e":{"id_":"a94606f2-6163-4a24-a808-dfe507c6c40e","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_14","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"bLOw+364nGncaYR0G2daCE/yfidUOsiUwnGqJkzOQbg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4ba5d257-a8a3-4220-a825-9cdb523b27ef","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"cSS2rG/zsg3EHEYBlQoOdQyyok1mLgIMZsn4JVB1zhs="}},"text":"Table 6:Recent  agriculture-specific  cybersecurity  solutions  that  combine  different  DL,  ML,  blockchain,  and\r\nFederated Learning (FL) based techniques.

Agri-\r\nculture  is  a  labor  and  time-intensive  work  evolving  to  increase  efficiency  and  food  production  to  satisfy  the\r\ngrowing demand [163]. To achieve these objectives, many farms have adopted AI to perform agricultural au-\r\ntomation [164]. It has been noted that many farm machinery companies are using field equipment to capture\r\ndata from the farms and transfer it to the centralized database [165, 137, 136, 166, 167]. This data is then\r\nfurther  used  in  AI  models  to  assist  farmers  in  decision-making. There  are  many  agricultural  AI  applications\r\nsuch as production management, crop monitoring, crop disease detection, food quality assessment, intelligent\r\nspraying of pesticides, soil management, and harvesting [168, 164] where the collected has been used. Recently,\r\nCross et al. [169] developed an AI-based decision support tool that can detect changes in the feeding behavior\r\nof pigs and provide warnings of potential disease outbreaks. A decision-support tool like this can be used by\r\nfarmers to take preventive actions that could increase the productivity of the animals. The other recent signif-\r\nicant application of AI is irrigation management. King and Shellie [170] used ANN to predict the Crop Water\r\nStress Index (CWSI). The objective was to develop a decision-support tool for wine grape production to assist\r\nwith irrigation. The development of AI-driven decision-support tools has also been reported for crop nutrient\r\nmanagement,  especially  to  recommend  optimum  Nitrogen  (N)  fertilizer  levels  for  corn  [171,  172,  173,  174]. The  N  fertilizers  play  a  crucial  role  in  corn  production  as  the  amount  of  N  fertilizers  affect  the  corn  yield,\r\naffecting profit and may cause pollution [173].

For  example,  let  us  assume  that  a  farmer  uses  an  AI-driven  N  fertilizer  recom-\r\nmender tool. When the soil pH level – a soil characteristic parameter - is high, the tool recommends increasing\r\nthe N input. This increases risks, and due to a lack of transparency, it is impossible to understand how the AI\r\nmodel  is  making  those  recommendations. Suppose  an  attacker  performs  a  DoS/DDoS  attack  on  the  farm’s\r\nnetwork. In that case, the pH parameters can be compromised, causing data poisoning and affecting recom-\r\nmendations on the optimum amount of N fertilizer [156]. This may result in massive losses to the farmer, as\r\nwell  as  causing  environmental  pollution. Additionally,  several  AI  challenges,  such  as  model  bias,  adversarial\r\nattacks,  data,  and  model  security,  affect  process  automation,  resulting  in  reduced  performance  of  IDSs  for\r\nthreat detection [175]. This creates a need to validate and verify (i.e.,  assure) an AI tool that the users can\r\ntrust. Further,  agriculture  is  a  primary  pillar  of  the  global  bioeconomy  [176],  which  highlights  the  following:\r\n“AI  must  be  ethical  to  make  the  right  decisions,  safe  to  protect  users  it  potentially  impacts,  explainable  so\r\nhumans  can  understand  it,  fair  in  the  decisions  it  makes,  trustworthy  so  we  have  confidence  in  its  abilities\r\nand secure to prevent cyberattacks and threats” [177]. Thus, it is crucial to deploy AI assurance as farms are\r\ngetting more digitized to validate and verify the AI models used.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"m2ld+/2lBaFp/zDyiNCCdSQsbGq5X/WYBAZfZ6/DkFk="},"42c5bdb7-3e1f-4c85-b45f-ddd96d86680b":{"id_":"42c5bdb7-3e1f-4c85-b45f-ddd96d86680b","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_16","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"mp9iky7QIqnuBeM7pHX5wjpaJh0O+N/KnBvmtFA12oA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7fa06829-6251-4f1e-a2c1-d1c16d989935","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"m2ld+/2lBaFp/zDyiNCCdSQsbGq5X/WYBAZfZ6/DkFk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"700fe7a1-d29c-4c5a-9c3a-a579c0b1bd8e","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"yZU1GZte9R3NJZxdNVBnoufCy6fX9c3SCxPR+bOjHXg="}},"text":"AI  assurance  can  be  defined  as  a  “process  that  is  applied  at  all  stages  of  the  AI  engineering  lifecycle\r\nensuring  that  any  intelligent  system  is  producing  outcomes  that  are  valid,  verified,  data-driven,  trustworthy\r\nand explainable to a layman, ethical in the context of its deployment, unbiased in its learning, and fair to its\r\nusers”  [178].

Figure 2:Six AI assurance goals that are needed for the verification and validation of AI. 4.1    The Farmer-Centered AI (FCAI) Framework\r\nOne  approach  to  achieving  AI  assurance  goals  is  integrating  human  interaction  in  the  AI  lifecycle,  known  as\r\nHuman-centered AI (HCAI), we restructure that and propose a Farmer-Centered AI, or the FCAI framework. In\r\nFCAI, farmers and AI get equal importance compared to the “traditional AI lifecycle”. FCAI focuses on farmers’\r\ninputs,  interactions,  and collaborations while designing,  training,  and evaluating AI [184, 185]. For instance,\r\nUAVs are used in agriculture for different applications such as crop disease detection, making harvest-related\r\ndecisions,  surveillance,  and  predicting  soil  parameters  [186,  187];  but  these  can  bring  different  challenges. Some  of  these  challenges  can  arise  regarding  AI  algorithms  and  farmers’  acceptance. AI  challenges,  such\r\nas  algorithm  generalizability  and  labeled  data  scarcity  depend  on  the  AI  developer  [187],  while  the  farmers’\r\nacceptance  solely  depends  on  them. Jarman  et  al. [188]  reported  that  the  results  generated  from  the  UAVs\r\nshould provide actionable information for agricultural practice, and it is critical to translate these into actionable\r\nsteps in the agriculture lifecycle. This example shows a need for engagement between AI developers and farmers\r\nto  use  AI  appropriately. Thus,  the  involvement  of  farmers  in  this  process  can  empower  and  enable  them  to\r\nfoster ethical, interactive, and contestable use of AI while uncovering underlying biases and limitations [189]. Accordingly,  FCAI  framework  can  provide  a  high  level  of  control  to  farmers  while  achieving  automation  of\r\nthe  agricultural  lifecycle.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"yZU1GZte9R3NJZxdNVBnoufCy6fX9c3SCxPR+bOjHXg="},"4375040b-c47b-492e-ace1-e4e669628f03":{"id_":"4375040b-c47b-492e-ace1-e4e669628f03","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_16","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"mp9iky7QIqnuBeM7pHX5wjpaJh0O+N/KnBvmtFA12oA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"700fe7a1-d29c-4c5a-9c3a-a579c0b1bd8e","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"yZU1GZte9R3NJZxdNVBnoufCy6fX9c3SCxPR+bOjHXg="}},"text":"As  noted  by  Shneiderman  [190],  this  approach  can  make  AI  reliable,  safe,  and\r\ntrustworthy for decision-making, benefiting individuals, families, communities, businesses, and society.

This is\r\nbecause networks of supply chains and Water & Wastewater Systems (WWS) connect with it. The previous\r\nsections reported vulnerabilities and impact on smart farms, but it has cascading effects that disrupt delivery\r\nto the Food Supply Chain (FSC) [198]. A FSC includes a set of activities, as noted by Nukala et al. [199], a\r\n“farm-to-fork” sequence. This sequence involves farmers, food producers/processors, food quality assessment,\r\nlogistics,  packaging,  warehousing,  and  marketing. Thus,  it  can  be  seen  that  the  FCS  depends  on  the  smart\r\nfarm  to  yield  the  crops  and  animal  products  that  can  be  processed  and  distributed  to  ensure  food  security. Considering the perishable nature of most farm products (before processing) and specific harvest times in the\r\nyear,  there  are  a  lot  of  uncertainties  in  the  operation  of  the  system. This  includes  the  early  links  that  form\r\nthe dependencies on the entire system [14]. To help deal with these uncertainties, the FSCs are also adopting\r\nemerging technologies like IoT and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), making it vulnerable\r\nto  cyberattacks  [200,  201]. Additionally,  attackers  can  attack  the  supply  chain  or  third-party  partners  that\r\nprovide  raw  materials  such  as  fertilizers,  grains,  and  stock  feed  affecting  the  farms  [16]. This  is  the  typical\r\ntechnological trade-off in critical infrastructure:  benefits for better monitoring, logistics, and decision-making\r\nat the cost of opening to data breaches and ransomware. These technologies, however, are adopted throughout\r\nseveral stages of the supply chain. For example, Latino and Menegoli [201] explain that the food and beverage\r\nindustry  is  applying  new  technology  to  the  stages  of  “farming,  transportation,  processing  and  the  packaging\r\nand storage of food products”.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"FUdeKFZi7QXk3LSGoPQkrGB7mbCReE7nH7zRagyFRTE="},"06590a0f-0b10-4c13-b9f8-37f95f3d4707":{"id_":"06590a0f-0b10-4c13-b9f8-37f95f3d4707","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_18","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"bL9eNu0SvAHMKgcgBAZTZguCzoLjsT2pz0omPJ8cxGE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bbe87340-92f7-4cd9-8013-93014ee80669","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"FUdeKFZi7QXk3LSGoPQkrGB7mbCReE7nH7zRagyFRTE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"62591935-6a69-4264-8c4e-28ad51834f4f","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"Sn/BwiLRHuSsnjAeZqHJiPbYq9AHUqB+q2TdiuJg5ek="}},"text":"In this, each layer has its technological network of interdependencies between\r\ncyber  and  physical  components,  and  then  strung  together,  forming  a  chain  of  dependencies. This  opens  up\r\nthe supply chain to vulnerabilities through cascading effects of cyberattacks at any one stage and potentially\r\nimpacting  later  stages  that  are  secure. For  example,  the  ransomware  attacks  noted  on  food  and  agriculture\r\ncompanies [52, 17, 70, 73, 77, 20] in Section 2 are real examples of this situation. Additionally, the ransomware\r\nattacks on grain companies such as Crystal Valley [73] and NEW Cooperative Inc. [77] interrupted the daily\r\noperations  of  these  companies. This  would  have  affected  the  farmers  because  Minnesota  and  Iowa  are  the\r\nthird and fourth largest producers of crops in the U.S., respectively. Another critical infrastructure sector that impacts agriculture and FSCs is the WWS sector. The WWS\r\nsector is one of the defining areas of critical infrastructure for agriculture because it provides water for irrigation,\r\ncrop cooling, frost control, and pesticide & fertilizer applications [202]. The agricultural water makes it possible\r\nto grow fresh produce and sustain livestock. It has been noted that 37% of the water goes towards irrigation\r\nof  crops,  which  is  the  second  largest  use  of  water  after  thermoelectric  power  production  [203]. Recently,  a\r\ntechnological shift has been observed toward adopting Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Systems Control\r\nand Data Acquisition (SCADA) in water systems. These technologies, without appropriate security measures,\r\nmake  the  water  systems  vulnerable  to  cyber  threats  [203,  31,  29]. Considering  more  than  a  third  of  our\r\nwater  supply  is  utilized  for  irrigation,  any  disruptions  in  WWS  cascade  the  impact  on  agriculture,  affecting\r\nfood  security  and  supply  chains.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"puJUz4FwlVdixhGUTYdCIGe0gm89IKlqVxJg430GUh4="},"62591935-6a69-4264-8c4e-28ad51834f4f":{"id_":"62591935-6a69-4264-8c4e-28ad51834f4f","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_18","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"bL9eNu0SvAHMKgcgBAZTZguCzoLjsT2pz0omPJ8cxGE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"06590a0f-0b10-4c13-b9f8-37f95f3d4707","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"puJUz4FwlVdixhGUTYdCIGe0gm89IKlqVxJg430GUh4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"861024a2-9d17-4a5d-98c0-2f1365aacb84","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"X2buCP3D5x9d940Gdz6s4KM3/RoErJjMovGjxlGd2PQ="}},"text":"Additionally,  a  subtle  change  in  the  chemical  agents  used  in  the  WWS,  for\r\nexample, sodium hydroxide, can change the pH level of the water [204].

Recently,  in  Florida,  an  adversary  tried  to  poison  the  water  by  changing  the  values\r\nof  sodium  hydroxide  in  the  system  [31]. This  happened  due  to  the  compromising  of  credentials.

This  attack  made  some  government  websites  unavailable  for  a  few  hours. As  noted  by  Geiller\r\nand Lee [205], government websites are crucial for efficient public administration, effective public services, and\r\nmaintaining the democratic legitimacy of the government. The government’s agricultural website can provide\r\ndifferent tools for farmers,  which becomes unavailable due to cyberattacks on the government websites. For\r\nexample, farmers.gov1offers local dashboards that provide insightful information on farming data and USDA\r\nresources  for  different  U.S. states. Additionally,  it  offers  different  tools  such  as  farm  loan  assistant  tools,\r\ndisaster assistance discovery tools, and conservation concern tools, which can help farmers in decision-making. Thus, a cyberattack on the government infrastructure, such as websites, could create delays in resource sharing\r\nand serving the country’s agricultural community. 5.2    Food Security, Accessibility & Availability\r\nCybersecurity incidents in the agricultural sector profoundly impact food security.

The incidents reported in this survey\r\nilluminate  the  multifaceted  challenges  in  the  agricultural  sector  to  maintain  operational  integrity. Farm  pro-\r\nduction, food processing, and supply chains are vital to the global food security network, but their connections\r\nwith  emerging  technologies  make  them  vulnerable  to  cyber  threats. This  highlights  the  need  for  heightened\r\nvigilance  and  robust  protective  measures. The  analyzed  cyber  incidents  in  the  agricultural  sector  manifest  a\r\ndiverse array of attack vectors, ranging from ransomware attacks [56, 17, 70, 75, 87] to unauthorized access\r\nthrough compromised credentials [62, 71] and sophisticated hacking techniques [50, 34]. This diversity under-\r\nscores the need for multifaceted security strategies to address a wide spectrum of cyber threats. Notably, these\r\nincidents resulted in substantial disruptions at various nodes within the agricultural supply chain, encompassing\r\nfarm operations [17, 70, 78], processing facilities [75, 92], and distribution [50, 56] networks. It has also been\r\nnoted that these attacks disrupted the communication networks, inventory management, and order fulfillment. This forced companies to apply containment measures, shut down operations, cancel or delay deliveries, and\r\nprioritize outbound shipments for expiring food products. In  the  aftermath  of  cyberattacks  on  the  agricultural  sector,  profound  consequences  impact  essential\r\nfood  availability  and  accessibility. The  cyberattacks  targeting  critical  nodes  within  the  sector,  such  as  meat,\r\ndairy, frozen food, and restaurant supply chains, disrupt the flow of essential food items to consumers. These\r\ndisruptions could occur throughout the entire production and distribution network. It causes shortages in crucial\r\nfood categories compromising the variety and availability of products on store shelves [78, 92].

The CARMA is a risk assessment program led by the DHS, FDA, and USDA, collaborating\r\nwith industry, academia, and government representatives. These initiatives were influenced by insights from the\r\nFood Industry Cybersecurity Summit [208] organized by the Food Protection and Defense Institute (FPDI) and\r\nsupported by the DHS Science and Technology Directorate. In 2016, this summit was held in Washington, D.C.,\r\nand  facilitated  discussions  among  nearly  40  participants  from  the  food  industry,  government,  and  academia.

The agriculture sector is unique and\r\ninteresting since it already faces weather/climate and price risks. That is, Cybersecurity is a third dimension\r\nto risks in the FA sector. The  review  of  cybersecurity  incidents  in  the  paper  indicates  direct  costs  measured  by  these  companies\r\nrange  from  a  few  to$202  million. Much  of  it  is  income  losses  and  disruptions  to  processes,  with  many\r\nother  direct  costs  unaccounted  for,  e.g.,  legal  issues  arising  from  privacy  loss. Thinking  along  the  lines  of\r\nweather/climate  and  price  risks,  the  cybersecurity  attacks  will  have  a  comparable  effect. That  is,  if  the\r\nrisk  is  not  addressed,  attacks  will  result  in  higher  prices  along  the  entire  supply  chain  affecting  consumers,\r\nproducers  (farmers),  processors,  wholesalers,  and  retailers. For  example,  Venkat  and  Masters  [211]  estimate\r\nprice increases of up to 42 percent for fruits, vegetables, dairy, and eggs following storms and droughts. With  squeezed  profitability,  since  the  agriculture  sector  does  not  have  high  pricing  power  (small  and\r\nmedium enterprises), business survival and job stability are the next set of economic challenges. Following up\r\non the storms and drought example, the high prices hurt consumers and do not necessarily benefit farmers and\r\nothers along the supply chain. The latter arises when prices of intermediates, e.g., energy and transportation\r\ncosts,  capture  most  of  the  margin  between  markets  and  production  points  at  the  time  of  weather  events. Additionally,  reputational  damage  and  stock  market  losses  can  make  companies  leave  the  agriculture  sector\r\ndisrupting domestic and global supply chains.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"iV9Sq1q93FtfYPUITbivZfVwbwcUy+K4XcqXPHHZoM4="},"001d75b7-1dd4-423e-a850-75d419d036cb":{"id_":"001d75b7-1dd4-423e-a850-75d419d036cb","metadata":{"page_number":21,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_21","metadata":{"page_number":21,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"IPFRmhV8F/KJ6zMNuXQrUtz+kWp1hx9yLFH6mUqbaxE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a270b820-5fcb-4f52-913f-ff02fe0b7cc9","metadata":{"page_number":21,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"iV9Sq1q93FtfYPUITbivZfVwbwcUy+K4XcqXPHHZoM4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4019b974-ce4e-492c-ba75-0ba6b4a887ac","metadata":{"page_number":21,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"RGcLtv8ctF42bXzXniT1rkbGzMBHjAgNW11a44tEl3k="}},"text":"With  cybersecurity  risks,  farmers  and  others  along  the  supply  chain  face  significant  uncertainties  in  the\r\nbusiness  environment. On  one  side,  they  ask  whether  or  not  investments  in  cybersecurity  are  worthwhile\r\ngiven their scale, limited pricing power and the public good properties of such systems. Simultaneously, they\r\nrecognize the consequences of an attack (direct and indirect costs). Uncertainties in business environment have\r\nbeen  shown  to  affect  investment,  consumption,  GDP  and  even  trade  among  nations  [212]. A  cybersecurity\r\nrisk management strategy is the need of hour in the agriculture sector, and it will require a public and private\r\npartnership. 5.4    Challenges\r\nThis sub-section discusses the challenges and potential solutions to improve the current state of utilization of\r\nAI in agriculture. Considering this, the three most relevant challenges are:  Data, Deployment, and Adoption. The details of these challenges are as follows. •Data- Data plays a crucial role in developing AI solutions, and it is a significant bottleneck in getting\r\nlabeled  high-quality  data  to  train  AI  models  [213]. Recent  surveys  published  by  Ferrang  et  al. [214]\r\nand Alwis et al. [215] listed different datasets that can be used for different smart farming applications. However, they are not specially obtained from agriculture or smart farms. It is essential to represent the\r\ncharacteristics of agriculture in the data to develop a robust AI solution. This creates a need to obtain\r\nhigh-quality domain-specific datasets. One of the possible solutions to make diverse,  high-quality data\r\navailable is using agriculture testbeds. Recently, Batarseh et al. [216] and Oberascher et al. [217] reported\r\nsoil testbeds that can help to produce agriculture-specific network and sensor data. This approach may\r\nhelp researchers to tackle data quality issues and provide robust AI solutions for agriculture. •Deployment– Deployment of AI solutions in real settings is another challenge observed in the agriculture\r\ndomain. Most security solutions, such as malware, DoS/DDoS detection systems, and intrusion detection\r\nfor UAVs, are not deployed.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Vzf+VzZND4L0zrMj3geuRzXXUpBKg4hGDIe6b0sBhNY="},"4019b974-ce4e-492c-ba75-0ba6b4a887ac":{"id_":"4019b974-ce4e-492c-ba75-0ba6b4a887ac","metadata":{"page_number":21,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_21","metadata":{"page_number":21,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"IPFRmhV8F/KJ6zMNuXQrUtz+kWp1hx9yLFH6mUqbaxE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"001d75b7-1dd4-423e-a850-75d419d036cb","metadata":{"page_number":21,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"Vzf+VzZND4L0zrMj3geuRzXXUpBKg4hGDIe6b0sBhNY="}},"text":"These security solutions are crucial for detecting and mitigating cybersecurity\r\nthreats  to  farms. The  deployment  of  AI  solutions  can  also  uncover  the  scalability  and  stability  issues\r\nthat may occur while using these solutions. Additionally, issues such as data and model drifts can occur\r\nwith the deployment of models, which also needs attention to use AI as a decision-support tool. •Adoption- The adoption of AI in everyday decision-making for farmers is challenges because it depends\r\non different factors such as personal, social, cultural, and economic [218, 219]. Prokopy et al. [220] noted\r\nthat the education level of farmers, capital, income, farm size, access to information, and environmental\r\nawareness  could  also  affect  adopting  new  technology. In  addition,  the  missing  link  between  AI  and\r\nAI  assurance  could  increase  the  risk  of  using  AI  at  the  farm,  affecting  farmers’  trust,  confidence,  and\r\nsafety. Thus, it is essential to incorporate AI assurance along with the deployment of AI applications and\r\ninvolve farmers in essential steps, as shown in FCAI framework. Further, providing informative sessions\r\non  explaining  the  need  for  AI,  its  use,  and  real-case  scenarios  could  also  help  increase  AI  adoption  in\r\nagriculture. 21","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"RGcLtv8ctF42bXzXniT1rkbGzMBHjAgNW11a44tEl3k="},"003108d1-9884-432b-be5a-b0c6e51f5545":{"id_":"003108d1-9884-432b-be5a-b0c6e51f5545","metadata":{"page_number":22,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_22","metadata":{"page_number":22,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"jx6/r1WQyrRDdqvVtcxO5TqitBQRt1ShoKblopvWk0Q="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b0429e73-94aa-4af8-bffa-36ce5abd0644","metadata":{"page_number":22,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"3pKDxaoanVVRu2/39U00Jp6jr6C/rmJRlDqDdpYk1NM="}},"text":"6    Epilogue\r\nThe  30  FA  incidents  reviewed  in  this  survey  spanned  over  11  years,  from  the  Monsanto  data  breach  in  2011\r\nto the Galil Sewage Corporation’s irrigation attack in 2023. Overall, it can be noted that ransomware attacks\r\ncaused  17  incidents  out  of  30,  and  it  is  the  most  common  form  of  attack. This  review  also  describes  four\r\nwidely used CSFs and recent AI-based cybersecurity solutions. These recent solutions reported in the survey are\r\napplications of AI, blockchain, and FL. By providing this analysis, we aspire that the cybersecurity incidents,\r\nalong  with  CSFs  and  AI  solutions,  could  act  as  an  informative  resource  to  guide  respective  stakeholders,\r\nfarmers,  and  policy  makers. Further,  this  survey  introduces  a  new  framework  that  encompasses  the  need\r\nfor  AI  assurance  in  the  agriculture  domain;  it  also  signifies  its  importance  for  the  validation  and  verification\r\nof  AI  overall. The  FCAI  framework  proposed  in  this  survey  incorporates  AI  assurance  in  the  AI  lifecycle  for\r\nagricultural  applications. Thus,  it  is  crucial  for  practitioners  to  consider  such  approaches  and  apply  AI  &\r\nAI  assurance  as  a  part  of  one  farm-to-fork  agricultural  supply  chain. This  discussion  therefore,  is  aimed  at\r\nhelping organizations and policymakers assess the interrelated effects of cyber threats.

The large scale and complexity\r\nof services make them more prone to failure. To maintain services’ normal and stable operation, alert and\r\nincident management (AIM), which analyzes and handles service failures in time, has become an important\r\ncontent of IT service management (ITSM). Many intelligent solutions have been proposed to improve the\r\nmanagement process. However, there is currently no comprehensive survey that systematically reviews related\r\nworks. Moreover, no integrated AIM architecture can cover each detailed process or most existing piecemeal\r\nsolutions. Therefore, we conduct an in-depth survey to address these problems. To the best of our knowledge,\r\nthe paper is the most comprehensive survey on intelligent AIM in IT services. Through this survey, we make the\r\nfollowing contributions. First, we summarize an integrated architecture that includes detailed AIM processes\r\nand key techniques. Second, we provide a systematic review of related works based on the architecture. Third,\r\nwe give a valuable analysis of current challenges and trends in AIM. 1. Introduction\r\nWith the progress of Information Technology (IT), IT services have\r\nbecome indispensable in our daily activities, such as online shopping,\r\nsocial networking, and entertainment. Service providers must maintain\r\nthe normal and stable operation of IT services to ensure the quality of\r\nservice (QoS) (Duan et al., 2003).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"68Vf3SFJXtkuEfn1hxCo2LJZbN1YyEY2GEgWq0vwoUg="},"c925562d-8880-4539-86b0-2743c1f21a66":{"id_":"c925562d-8880-4539-86b0-2743c1f21a66","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"qOrhhfGqr6xOk7RVUWPRhjlnXsaFOu7NB+7ALU44qW4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"95a40111-1af0-4565-85c0-03a68e86ec5a","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"68Vf3SFJXtkuEfn1hxCo2LJZbN1YyEY2GEgWq0vwoUg="}},"text":"IT service management (ITSM) (Kr-\r\nishnan and Ravindran, 2017) plays a vital role in the daily operations\r\nof IT services, including a set of activities to ensure service level\r\nagreements (SLAs) (Raimondi et al., 2008). With the development of virtualization, cloud, big data, and mi-\r\ncroservice, IT services are becoming more large-scale and complex. Fig. 1 shows an IT service system with numerous components and\r\ncomplex logical relationships (Zhao et al., 2020c). Accordingly, in-\r\ncidents (unplanned interruptions/outages) of the service (Lou et al.,\r\n2013) are usually inevitable. Meanwhile, they could destroy service\r\nquality and incur huge economic losses. For example, Amazon’s one-\r\nhour downtime on Prime Day may lead to the loss of up to $100 million\r\nin sales.1Therefore, incident management (IcM) (Zhou et al., 2017;\r\nChen et al., 2020b) is vital and has become one of the most critical\r\nprocesses in ITSM. At present, many IT service providers have established systems of\r\nalert and incident management (AIM), as shown in  Fig. 2.

Yu et al. Fig.2.Overview of AIM in IT service system. from the service system. Once these monitoring data violate predefined\r\nalerting rules, alerts would be generated to notify engineers to pay\r\nattention to them (Zhao et al., 2020c). Next, alert management is\r\nresponsible for processing numerous raw alerts from the monitoring\r\nsystem and identifyingseverealerts. These severe alerts, as well asuser\r\ncomplaints, are treated asincidents, which are further handled by the\r\nincident management process. The incident management goals are to\r\nassign the incidents to responsible teams, localize the root causes (Solé\r\net al., 2017), and resolve the incidents as soon as possible to ensure\r\nservice stability. Traditionally, manual AIM is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, various solutions (see Section 3.4) have been proposed\r\nto handle alerts and incidents in an automatic and intelligent way. Such a body of works also contributes to the operations paradigm shift\r\nknown as Artificial intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) (Dang et al.,\r\n2019; Notaro et al., 2020; Sabharwal and Bhardwaj, 2022; Rijal et al.,\r\n2022), i.e., utilizing Artificial Intelligence to enhance IT Operations. This study aims to understand AIM by providing a uniform archi-\r\ntecture as well as the latest progress in this area. However, to our\r\nknowledge, no uniform AIM architecture can fully describe each AIM\r\nprocess or comprise most existing piecemeal solutions. In addition,\r\nno thorough AIM survey reviews the state-of-the-art works (see Sec-\r\ntion 3.3). Therefore, we conducted the survey focusing on AIM (as\r\nshown in the red dashed frame of Fig. 2) to tackle these problems. The\r\npaper surveys 89 representative research papers from the last 15 years\r\n(2008–2022) in detail and makes the main contributions as follows. 1. The paper summarizes an integrated AIM architecture that con-\r\nsists of various processes and can cover most existing piecemeal\r\nsolutions. This architecture can help readers have a thorough\r\nunderstanding of the AIM workflow and design and evolve the\r\nmanagement system for industrial purposes. 2.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"PBM3lt773DLjl7qUKPXsRxb6LMafZenDm0fpyq90pak="},"b0b3e0b9-7780-4bd3-be05-2af15a092a29":{"id_":"b0b3e0b9-7780-4bd3-be05-2af15a092a29","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"CVPb7NrvjUu6XRAnw11XUYnlgnCWcpyYJJB0BEdeSO8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"afdbcea9-c9eb-4908-884d-22c5d4a5c1d3","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"PBM3lt773DLjl7qUKPXsRxb6LMafZenDm0fpyq90pak="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8bec98e0-722b-419f-a080-8f9fa32dc51d","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"nc8KNtS4QmyL/S/bcKQkW51qzgS0ESD+M4J96MCURAk="}},"text":"2.

As shown in Fig. 2, an alert does not necessarily lead to an\r\nincident. Meanwhile, an incident does not necessarily have a reported\r\nalert, e.g., some incidents are reported by user complaints only. In\r\nterms of severity, incidents are usually more severe than alerts, and\r\nalerts are more severe than events in general. Besides, events, alerts,\r\nand incidents can all generate notifications to engineers, depending on\r\nthe specific settings of the organization. 2.3. Rootcauseanalysis\r\nTo completely resolve an incident, experts will analyze the root\r\ncause of it. Traditionally, experts manually investigate root causes\r\nbased on their domain knowledge (e.g., the dependencies between\r\nservice components) and related data analysis (e.g., metrics and logs). However, the manual analysis will cost much time and effort, and is\r\nnot conducive to the quick resolution of incidents. Therefore, many\r\ntechniques have been proposed to improve RCA (łgorzata Steinder and\r\nSethi, 2004; Solé et al., 2017; Soldani and Brogi, 2022).

Yu et al. 2.3.1. Dependencygraphconstruction\r\nThere are two major ways to construct the dependency graph for\r\nroot cause analysis: system architecture analysis and causality discov-\r\nery. The system architecture provides accurate dependencies among\r\ncomponents. For example, call relationships of services or microservices\r\ncan be regarded as dependencies (Kim et al., 2013; Li et al., 2022d,a;\r\nZhang et al., 2021). In this context, if serviceAcalls serviceB, thenA\r\ndepends onB. Thus, the dependency graph can be represented by the\r\ncall graph generated based on sensors deployed on the components. Resource-sharing relationships among components are also dependen-\r\ncies, which can further enhance the dependency graph (Weng et al.,\r\n2018; Wu et al., 2020). For example, if virtual machineAand virtual\r\nmachineBare located at the same physical machine, or serviceA\r\nandBare dependent on the same storage, then they have dependency\r\neven if they do not directly call each other. Besides the coarse-grained\r\nservice-level and virtual machine-level dependencies, traces are utilized\r\nin many approaches (e.g., TraceAnomaly (Liu et al., 2020a), Micro-\r\nRank (Yu et al., 2021), Sage (Gan et al., 2021), TraceRCA (Li et al.,\r\n2021b)) to acquire span-level dependencies. Some other works learn the dependency relationship automatically\r\nfrom the historical monitoring data of the components. The PC al-\r\ngorithm (Spirtes et al., 2000; Kalisch and Bühlman, 2007), a causal\r\nrelationship learning algorithm, is widely used to identify dependencies\r\nin different levels, such as performance metric level (Chen et al.,\r\n2014; Ma et al., 2019, 2020; Meng et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2022),\r\nAPI level (Wang et al., 2018a), alert level (Zhang et al., 2020), and\r\nmicroservice level (Lin et al., 2018a).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"lIkxhUwTZ6YZkNVhA7ImXAlELlaEveJrj7RcEvVGAe8="},"d75a737c-0e61-4691-b3a9-c5bbc645e9cd":{"id_":"d75a737c-0e61-4691-b3a9-c5bbc645e9cd","metadata":{"page_number":4,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_4","metadata":{"page_number":4,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"uSclxjRP8nYarp8sWnyppWUNi6WM8e2FsZHCBgOHvHs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c7ec393a-954c-4f1f-8959-adc52f5efd35","metadata":{"page_number":4,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"lIkxhUwTZ6YZkNVhA7ImXAlELlaEveJrj7RcEvVGAe8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"029120aa-7a0e-4ce9-8de9-78d3ccd34588","metadata":{"page_number":4,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"41ofFwP65xwlzpvB8+9BfKuTaQ6kkDZ266VbcztRBwM="}},"text":"Moreover, the Granger Causality\r\ntests (Granger, 1969) are used to infer component dependencies (Thal-\r\nheim et al., 2017). 2.3.2. Rootcauseinference\r\nAfter constructing the dependency graph, a method is in need to\r\ninfer the root cause based on the dependency graph. Some works (Kim\r\net al., 2013; Weng et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018a;\r\nMa et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) assume that the metrics of root-\r\ncause components are similar to those of the affected components. Thus, a random walker aiming to find the root cause should iteratively\r\ngo to the neighbors with higher metric similarity. Therefore, they use\r\nrandom walk (Spitzer, 2013) with metric similarity as the transition\r\nprobability to infer the root cause. Moreover, some works (Chen et al.,\r\n2014; Lin et al., 2018a; Liu et al., 2020a, 2021) directly apply a\r\nDepth First Search (DFS) method to find the most upstream abnor-\r\nmal component on the dependency graph.

Methodology\r\nWe collect literature in a snowballing manner (Wohlin, 2014). We\r\nfirst identify 16 seed papers from those published in relevant confer-\r\nences and journals in recent years, including SIGKDD ’17, ICSE ’19–22,\r\nESEC/FSE ’20, ASE ’19–21, and INFOCOM ’20. Then, a keywords-\r\nbased database search (MacDonell et al., 2010) is performed to make\r\nup for the lack of initial literature, using keywords (‘‘alarm’’, ‘‘alert’’,\r\n‘‘incident’’, and ‘‘ticket’’) to search popular online digital libraries (IEEE\r\nXplore, ACM Digital Library, Springer Online, and Elsevier Online). For the paper screening, we comprehensively consider their quality\r\nand relevance to the theme. We notice that many studies are for\r\nnetwork security alerts, which analyze network attacks. As monitoring\r\nsystems for IT services typically generate two types of alerts, i.e., system\r\nalerts (as shown in Table 1) and network alerts indicating the network\r\nperformance and reliability, those network security alert-related works\r\nare out of the topic of this survey. After the search, we extend the list of\r\npapers by recursively examining those referred by or referring to any\r\nincluded one, which also follows the paper screening above.

Yu et al. Fig.5.Illustration of AIM architecture. (see Section 4). Alert correlation reduces the volume of alerts to be\r\nanalyzed and provides more valuable information for current problems,\r\nas the raw alerts are usually massive and contain miscellaneous infor-\r\nmation. Alert storm handling resolves extreme alert storm problems\r\nwhen alert correlation techniques are unavailable or do not work well. Alert determination aims to identify severe alerts for creating incident\r\ntickets, while non-severe alerts are usually ignored. The incident management module is responsible for tackling in-\r\ncident tickets and resolving problems described in the tickets (see\r\nSection 5). Traditionally, incident management includes three stages,\r\ni.e., incident triage, mitigation, and resolution (Chen et al., 2020a). Incident triage is to find the accountable expert (group) for each inci-\r\ndent ticket. After an incident is assigned, the corresponding expert first\r\nperforms mitigation actions quickly to mitigate the incident. Finally,\r\nthe expert explores the root cause and ultimately acts to resolve the\r\nincident based on an in-depth analysis. This process is called inci-\r\ndent resolution. This paper first introduces two building blocks for\r\nautomated ticket analysis, named ticket representation and incident\r\nlinking. Ticket representation transfers textual tickets into structural\r\ndata, while incident linking provides a more informative overview of\r\ncurrent problems to support the three traditional stages. After that,\r\npapers related to the three stages are reviewed respectively. There are three types of roles in the architecture: service users,\r\nOCEs, and experts. If service users encounter issues when using the\r\nservice, user complaints will be sent to the system and become one\r\nof the primary sources of incidents. OCEs, also called system admin-\r\nistrators or operators in some papers, are mainly involved in three\r\nprocesses: alert determination, incident ticket creation, and incident\r\ntriage. Finally, experts, who are also referred to as subject matter\r\nexperts (SMEs) (Gupta et al., 2008a) or service engineers, perform quick\r\nmitigation and final resolution of incidents based on in-depth analysis\r\nof the root causes of incidents as well as some prior knowledge and\r\nexperience. 3.3.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"pTkF5s7WaLhEscsOgLGgoczXUWkA7e0llOfnUMWyJg8="},"41a1089f-b4dd-4faa-9c11-f35868f1af99":{"id_":"41a1089f-b4dd-4faa-9c11-f35868f1af99","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_5","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"0TbDo6aAojDvPAkmVXFarryMQQJfzkos4+yNKeSd7x4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f52940e1-9347-43d6-9ba7-e38090efbc4f","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"pTkF5s7WaLhEscsOgLGgoczXUWkA7e0llOfnUMWyJg8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"008acf6b-d644-4a54-8a57-0f28d41cfe4c","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"0ezaZegIcw9Vp7VJDrP29k+ZcRwLJA3zoh1oQus+3Z0="}},"text":"3.3.

Alertmanagement\r\nAs shown in Fig. 5, alert management is responsible for identifying\r\nsevere alerts from raw alerts generated by the monitoring system for\r\ncreating incident tickets. However, the raw alerts are challenging to\r\nanalyze due to large numbers, false alerts, etc. In order to solve the\r\nproblem of alerts’ large volume, some works correlate raw alerts to\r\nreduce the effort to analyze alerts and provide concise information to\r\ndescribe current alerting problems. We categorize these works as the\r\ncontent ofalertcorrelation. Nevertheless, as many service environments\r\ndo not apply alert correlation technologies or the technologies do not\r\nalways work, extreme situations called alert storms sometimes occur. So some works focus on handling alert storms. We categorize these\r\nworks as the content ofalert storm handling. Last but not least, it\r\nis necessary to determine whether alerts are severe and need to be\r\nresolved. Traditionally, these tasks are done manually by OCEs, which\r\nis inefficient. Therefore, some automated methods are proposed. We\r\ncategorize these works as the content ofalertdetermination. 4.1. Alertcorrelation\r\nThe number of raw alerts is usually huge, but each alert contains\r\nonly a little information that cannot provide an overview of the cur-\r\nrent problems. To tackle this problem, alert correlation techniques are\r\nproposed to alleviate alert analysis pressure and provide more practical\r\ninformation to describe current issues. In the intrusion detection system (IDS), two types of works can\r\neffectively reduce the effort of analyzing alerts by integrating alerts,\r\ni.e., alert aggregation and alert correlation. In this context, alert ag-\r\ngregation identifies and clusters different alerts belonging to a specific\r\nattack instance. Alert correlation is to link the alerts from the same\r\nattack process together to rebuild the attack course (Chengpo et al.,\r\n2006). However, current alert indicators in IT services are much more\r\nthan the previous intrusion attacks, and there is no clear boundary\r\nbetween alert aggregation and alert correlation as their goals are the\r\nsame. Moreover, similar works are called alert fusion (Zang et al., 2008)\r\nin some literature.

Therefore, feature se-\r\nlection is often one basic and important step in many alert analysis\r\nworks. Traditional feature selection is usually made manually based\r\non knowledge and experience, which may not be accurate enough. A further approach is to use feature engineering (Kuhn and Johnson,\r\n2019) for this task (Asres et al., 2020). Moreover, Alhaj et al. (2016)\r\nproposed a 2-tier feature selection method for improving attribute-\r\nbased alert correlation, which automatically selects appropriate and\r\nsignificant features using Information Gain. Attribute-based methods are most commonly used for the network\r\n(security) alert correlation because alerts with the same source IP\r\naddress, target IP address, port, etc., are significantly related. For ex-\r\nample, a probabilistic strategy (Valdes and Skinner, 2001) is presented\r\nto correlate alerts based on the similarity of their overlapping attributes\r\nwithout considering their unique attributes. Besides, Man et al. (2012)\r\nproposed a clustering algorithm that iteratively calculates the average\r\nvalue of classes as the new clustering center based on random selection,\r\nmerging, and dividing dynamically. For the correlation of service alerts, Lin et al. (2014) proposed a\r\nhierarchical clustering method to correlate alerts based on the text. Specifically, it first represents each alert as a bag of words and creates a\r\ndistance matrix based on natural language processing (NLP) techniques,\r\nand uses the Jaccard distance metric to compare any two alerts. Then,\r\nalerts are clustered based on the distance matrix using a graph-theoretic\r\napproach which uses connected component detection to generate initial\r\nclusters before applying the graph-cut algorithm to further refine the\r\nclusters. But a purely attribute-based method tends to be less effective\r\nbecause correlating the alerts of the same service, device, etc., is too\r\nrudimentary. Besides, correlating alerts based on other attributes, such\r\nas the alert key, lacks reasonable explanations, as the alerts of similar\r\nindicators in different services or components are not necessarily re-\r\nlated. Therefore, few studies correlate service alerts only based on the\r\nsimilarity of service alert attributes.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"hnqknIsENZmYmGXVwUM8RyokArHER6p1wZHNW2rGBYg="},"0996a1ec-5e6b-4e8c-a0c1-69d0b34204fd":{"id_":"0996a1ec-5e6b-4e8c-a0c1-69d0b34204fd","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_8","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"60N8q0Ljgbc7n6Xtbj5RIlyrueqMq6Mz2KEPIE2ZboA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0a652f7f-c5ad-42ae-989d-6d769187d42b","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"hnqknIsENZmYmGXVwUM8RyokArHER6p1wZHNW2rGBYg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"69cc1b67-da87-43c4-a95a-0434dc1cfbb6","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"L5VJL6ppcFLAvOEbTSiyWflL2uaE7yO3Ea0GDztwmP4="}},"text":"Therefore, few studies correlate service alerts only based on the\r\nsimilarity of service alert attributes. 4.1.2. Dependency-basedmethods\r\nDependency-based methods mainly use various known or learned\r\ndependencies among alerts to correlate them. Early solutions use prede-\r\nfined static rules to correlate alerts, where the rules are mainly gained\r\nfrom experience and knowledge. Further, some works (e.g., Mannila\r\nand Toivonen (1996)) try to mine frequent sequence patterns from alert\r\nsequences, which can be used as correlation rules to correlate alerts. But\r\nthese rules are pre-learned or predefined and cannot adapt to changes\r\nin the environment, which are not intelligent enough. Therefore, Costa\r\net al. (2009) proposed a smart and adaptive alert correlation architec-\r\nture, which uses a rule discovery approach to generate the rules based\r\non alerts and incident tickets. In particular, the approach is independent\r\nof the network topology and uses incident ticket information to get\r\nfeedback from the correlation results based on an association rule\r\nalgorithm. However, in modern large-scale service systems, service compo-\r\nnents are numerous and have complex dependencies. A failure of\r\none component may cause a series of alerts.

The core of these works is to find the de-\r\npendencies. Thus some dependency learning methods in Section 2.3.1\r\ncan be used to achieve this goal.

Besides, some statistical approaches are\r\nadopted to learn the dependencies of alerts, such as Pearson correlation\r\ncoefficient (Mahimkar et al., 2009) and Granger causality (Yin and\r\nYao, 2016). But Pearson correlation coefficient cannot discover the\r\nnon-linear or non-functional relationships amongst alerts, and Granger\r\ncausality assumes the lags between two alerts are stable, which does\r\nnot always hold in IT service alerts.

Summary\r\nAlert correlation techniques mainly have two application scenarios. One is correlating real-time alerts to provide intuitive and effective\r\ninformation reflecting current problems. Another is correlating cur-\r\nrent alerts with similar historical alerts for using historical handing\r\ninformation to analyze current issues. As mentioned earlier, attribute-\r\nbased methods combine multiple attributes to correlate alerts, which\r\ncan uncover associations that are challenging to find with dependent-\r\nbased methods. These methods can work for both two scenarios. How-\r\never, the interpretability of these methods is lacking. In contrast, the\r\ndependency-based methods are more interpretable as they correlate\r\nalerts using the dependency relationships of alerts or their components\r\nand indicators. Moreover, the dependencies can provide engineers with\r\nmore intuitive and practical information to analyze current problems. But dependency-based methods mainly work for the first scenario as\r\nthey cannot correlate similar alerts. Hybrid methods combine alert\r\nattributes and dependencies. Thus they should be more effective, fitting\r\nboth two scenarios. But they usually require large and comprehensive\r\nlabeled data, which are challenging to obtain. 4.2. Alertstormhandling\r\nIn real-world ITSM, the alert number sometimes far exceeds what\r\nengineers can handle. Such an extreme situation is called thealertstorm. As a real and ubiquitous phenomenon in the IT service environment,\r\nthe alert storm has become one major pain point in the current alert\r\nmanagement. Why do alert storms occur?The alert storm occurs mainly due to\r\nthe large scale and complexity of the service system (e.g., Fig. 1). On\r\nthe one hand, the failures of common components used by multiple\r\nservices cause these services to be affected and many alerts generated. On the other hand, the propagation of failures between related compo-\r\nnents further exacerbates the generation of alerts. Intuitively, the alert\r\ncorrelation can effectively handle alert storms by correlating relevant\r\nalerts to reduce the analysis effort. However, since the alert correlation\r\nmethods are not used in some service environments, or the actual\r\neffectiveness of these methods is not ideal, alert storms still occur.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ywmc+X78TPhKbObLb6URxIOggijFhomIn3hEPkODCUk="},"79c123be-4d75-43af-8522-440d424d7bb4":{"id_":"79c123be-4d75-43af-8522-440d424d7bb4","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_9","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"D6o/qae53IPLEn2oy7vRdwn50uMxpQ0dTK2NKmEPpLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a5f51d54-01b9-47c0-948f-95334bc1f6db","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"ywmc+X78TPhKbObLb6URxIOggijFhomIn3hEPkODCUk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"425613a1-2297-4fbf-b157-058cad8591a6","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"IdpE38tFENNH9TOLoJNYCeGbym8YPdkcArh9MKtl4zs="}},"text":"4.2.1.

Some previous standards,\r\nsuch as ISA 18.2 (International Society of Automation (ISA), 2009) and\r\nEEMUA 191 (Equipment and Association, 1999), suggest identifying\r\nthe alert flood when the alerting rate is higher than ten alerts per\r\n10 min per operator (Ahmed et al., 2013; Lai et al., 2017).

Networkalertstorm\r\nIn a network alert management system in about 2011, Yang et al. (2011) found that memory depletion of the system is not caused by a\r\nhigh alert arrival rate but by excessive system process delays. When\r\nthe system is required to maintain a state of alerts, it needs to keep\r\nsome alert information describing ongoing transactions of these alerts\r\nfor a certain period. In such a case, all memory may be occupied and\r\nunable to process new alerts. They explored an approach to managing\r\nthe network alert storm by calculating inter-process latency, which\r\nis the time alerts spend waiting to be handled, based on dynamic\r\nstates of alerts and behaviors of system performance. It provides QOS\r\ntrending projection functionality of inter-process latency to manage\r\nCPU and memory capacity and to trigger the control mechanism to\r\nprotect system resources. However, system resources are usually not the\r\nbottleneck in the current alert management system. The main challenge\r\nis that operators cannot identify real issues that need to be addressed\r\nfrom the alert storm. For network security alert storms, Landauer et al. (2022) presented\r\na framework for automatic and domain-independent alert aggregation,\r\nwhich does not need specific alert formats. The approach mainly con-\r\nsists of rule-based algorithms that group alerts by occurrence times,\r\ncluster these groups by similarity, and extract commonalities to model\r\nmeta-alerts without merging all considered alerts into a single common\r\nformat. Based on these metrics and techniques, they proposed an\r\nincremental procedure for generating abstract alert patterns that enable\r\ncontinuous classification of incoming alerts. As a result, the approach\r\ntransforms alerts generated by IDS into higher-level meta-alerts that\r\nrepresent specific attack patterns.

Alertdetermination\r\nIn many IT service systems, especially business-sensitive services\r\n(such as digital banking), the monitoring systems report all suspicious\r\nalerts that may affect the systems’ normal operations to avoid miss-\r\ning potential incidents. This way causes reporting many false alerts\r\nor low-priority alerts that cost much effort to handle. Even if some\r\norganizations optimize the alerting rules as much as possible, false\r\nalerts and missed alerts still abound. Alert determination is to identify\r\nreal alerts or problems that need to be ticketed for subsequent handling\r\nfrom many alerts. Traditionally, the alert determination is manually\r\ndone by OCEs. Unfortunately, manual analysis leads to low efficiency. Sometimes the alerts even exceed what OCEs can properly investi-\r\ngate (Hassan et al., 2019). Therefore, some automated methods were\r\nproposed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the manual\r\nway. These methods can be divided into three types:alertdistinguishing,\r\nwhich determines whether an alert is real;severe alert identification,\r\nwhich discovers a few critical alerts from many alerts; andalert-based\r\nincidentidentification, which identifies incidents from a group of alerts. 4.3.1. Alertdistinguishing\r\nAlert distinguishing methods identify the authenticity of each alert. Tang et al.

Yu et al. 5.1. Incidentrepresentation\r\nRepresenting the incident ticket text as a numeric form that subse-\r\nquent methods can use is the basis of the automated analysis. Ticket\r\nrepresentation typically starts from textual featurization, in which the\r\nticket content is divided into features (Diao et al., 2009). The typical\r\nway represents the ticket text as a bag of words divided based on\r\nspace or symbols. Then, these words are transformed into a vector\r\nspace model for subsequent analysis. However, the raw text of tickets\r\nis challenging to use. Correspondingly, some methods are used to solve\r\nexisting challenges. The main challenges and solutions are as follows. •The descriptive text manually recorded may have many vari-\r\nations. First, spelling errors are common and unavoidable. So\r\nsome spelling correction techniques (Hládek et al., 2020) can be\r\nused. Second, a word may have different forms (e.g., different\r\ntenses and voices, singular and plural). Hence, some stemming\r\ntechniques (Moral et al., 2014; Singh and Gupta, 2017) can be\r\napplied, such as Porter’s algorithm (Porter, 1980), which is one\r\nof the most classic stemming techniques. Third, some synonyms\r\nand compound terms may affect analysis results. Hence, syn-\r\nonym detection and compound term processing techniques can\r\nbe used (Shimpi et al., 2014; Yu, 2008). •The words on tickets have different parts of speech. Building Part-\r\nOf-Speech (POS) tags for the words is important for text analysis. To solve this challenge, some NLP methods, such as Stanford\r\nPOS Tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003; Toutanova and Manning,\r\n2000), are used to identify the nouns, verbs, etc., in the ticket\r\ntext (Agarwal et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2017). •Some words are meaningless and even adversely affect the subse-\r\nquent analysis. These words are regarded as stopwords. Filtering\r\nout stopwords is essential. Many works manually define stop-\r\nwords based on domain knowledge.

They sorted all words in descending order\r\nof total count and chose the top k words as stopwords. In addition, Tang et al. (2013a) proposed a representation method\r\nfor monitoring tickets based on attribute-based features, including\r\ncategorical features (e.g., hostname, process name), numeric features\r\n(e.g., CPU utilization, disk free space percentage), and textual features\r\n(e.g., incident description). Zhou et al. (2015b) and Zhou et al. (2016) found that using semantic features to represent monitoring\r\ntickets was better than using attribute-level features. They proposed\r\na feature extraction approach to represent ticket information using\r\ntopic-level features obtained via the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)\r\nmodel (Blei et al., 2003).

Chen et al. (2021) proposed GRLIA, an incident aggregation framework\r\nbased on graph representation learning. GRLIA comprises two incident\r\nlinking methods. In the offline analysis phase, the first method links the\r\nincidents that may be triggered by each individual failure based on a\r\nwell-known community detection algorithm called Louvain algorithm. Then an embedding vector is learned for different types of incidents by\r\nleveraging existing graph representation learning models. In the online\r\nincident linking phase, the second method employs the learned incident\r\nrepresentation to link incidents by considering their cosine similarity\r\nand topological distance. 5.2.3. Supervisedlearningbasedmethods\r\nThese methods use supervised learning methods to link incidents. Xu et al. (2020) proposed a multi-view similarity measure framework\r\nto integrate several kinds of existing similarity measures, including\r\nsurface matching based, semantic-based, and syntax-based measures. A supervised method is used to determine the similarity threshold\r\nscore for each measure. In particular, they used a machine learning\r\nbased policy to integrate various similarity measures in a more gen-\r\neral way, which makes the framework flexible and extensible. Chen\r\net al.

Incidenttriage\r\nIncident triage is to find a suitable expert (group) for an incident\r\nticket to solve it. Traditionally, OCEs manually finish this task, re-\r\nquiring specific domain knowledge to identify where the problem lies,\r\ne.g., database, storage, and network. However, it is challenging for\r\nOCEs to master various domain knowledge. Furthermore, IT services’\r\nlarge scale and complexity increase the challenge as needing many\r\nexpert groups responsible for different system components.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"vyJrfLrWPJN12aGA/juELFILbo1vr/Ij8FUmCgPW3Qc="},"bacf922c-016f-407e-a6b6-2bf64cf8fef3":{"id_":"bacf922c-016f-407e-a6b6-2bf64cf8fef3","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_12","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"qsb1rxB5Bbe2jt5LxdaDWe4D8XqPfmyZzExPO5T8lBg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"54bd3e32-ecb7-46a9-bccc-cd3c688bb64e","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"vyJrfLrWPJN12aGA/juELFILbo1vr/Ij8FUmCgPW3Qc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a9bc7324-55e8-4c05-81a6-2ccd2da70497","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"vDiU/YY2vppH6tFc/szCIaJr/SH5x+A/xpo2m3b2NLU="}},"text":"So the\r\nmanual way is usually inefficient, costing much time and human effort. Therefore, some automated methods have been proposed to improve\r\nefficiency and effectiveness from two perspectives, i.e., automating\r\nticket triage and providing auxiliary information to OCEs to help triage. 5.3.1. Automatedtriagemethods\r\nThe goal of automated triage is to automatically find the correct\r\nexperts for tickets. Ticket triage can also be regarded as one content\r\nof expert recommendation, which is also known as expert finding,\r\nexpert retrieval, or expert search. However, expert recommendation\r\nfar exceeds the field of ticket triage, and there are many related\r\nworks (Nikzad-Khasmakhi et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2017; Yuan et al.,\r\n2020). Correspondingly, this section introduces only the works on the\r\nticket triage field. We summarize various related works based on the\r\nfeatures they use (see Table 6). Content-based Methods.The content-based methods deal with\r\nticket triage only using the text information of tickets, considering\r\nhistorical tickets contain associations between experts and ticket de-\r\nscriptions. Most of these works Agarwal et al. (2012), Dasgupta et al. (2014) and Zeng et al. (2014) consider ticket triage as a text classifi-\r\ncation problem. Godbole and Roy (2008) and Agarwal et al. (2012)\r\nsuggested the Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Joachims, 1998) to\r\nbe generally superior to some other technologies, such as decision\r\ntrees, Bayesian networks, and K-means, in this field. Accordingly, SVM\r\nbecame a widely used classifier for ticket triage. Agarwal et al. (2012)\r\nused two attributes (i.e., description and resolution group) of historical\r\nmanual tickets to train a classifier for resolution groups based on the\r\ncombination of SVM and a discriminative term based approach. Then\r\nthe classifier can predict the most appropriate resolution group for a\r\nnew ticket. Dasgupta et al. (2014) presented an approach that com-\r\nprised a correlation model and a classification model.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"I3ho1jXX7Eb/bvMfC3i4iqsbmq0ZhRoCt19LEltUqg4="},"a9bc7324-55e8-4c05-81a6-2ccd2da70497":{"id_":"a9bc7324-55e8-4c05-81a6-2ccd2da70497","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_12","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"qsb1rxB5Bbe2jt5LxdaDWe4D8XqPfmyZzExPO5T8lBg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bacf922c-016f-407e-a6b6-2bf64cf8fef3","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"I3ho1jXX7Eb/bvMfC3i4iqsbmq0ZhRoCt19LEltUqg4="}},"text":"(2014) presented an approach that com-\r\nprised a correlation model and a classification model.

In practice, the group that can resolve\r\nan incident may be very different from the current group, such as the\r\ndatabase group and network group. Therefore, one-time assignment\r\nmethods are not the best for reassignments. Due to the service system’s large scale and complexity, an incident\r\nticket’s dispatching process may involve multiple expert groups and\r\nform a routing sequence until it reaches the expert who can handle\r\nit. The ticket routing sequence describes a ticket dispatch’s complete\r\nprocesses, and each process represents one expert’s actions that handle\r\nthe incident. Considering the fact that historical routing sequences\r\nprovide rich information about the relationship between experts, some\r\nworks (Shao et al., 2008b,a; Miao et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2014)\r\ncomplete ticket reassignments utilizing only the routing information. The methods are called sequence-based methods. Shao et al. (2008b,a) developed EasyTicket, a ticket routing rec-\r\nommendation tool which comprises a Markov model to capture the\r\ntransfer decisions from historical resolution sequences and a search al-\r\ngorithm to generate transfer recommendations without accessing ticket\r\ncontent. Some other works (Miao et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2014) take\r\nrouting sequences as collaborative networks, a particular type of social\r\nnetwork formed by participants who collectively achieve specific goals,\r\nsuch as fixing software bugs and resolving incidents. Miao et al. (2012)\r\nproposed a network model to simulate real collaborative networks and\r\na routing model to simulate human collaboration dynamics. This model\r\ncan jointly simulate the structure and the ticket routing procedure. In contrast, Sun et al. (2014) directly inferred the routing models in\r\nreal collaborative networks without simulating a collaborative network. More specifically, they formalized multiple routing patterns into a\r\ngenerative model to formulate experts’ routing decisions. Hybrid Methods.Hybrid methods deal with the triage tasks by\r\nutilizing multiple information (e.g., ticket content, routing sequence,\r\nand expert ability). Some works Sun et al.

As the third one is globally optimized, it should\r\nperform better than the first two. In contrast to the supervised methods above, Botezatu et al. (2015)\r\nused an unsupervised learning method to handle ticket triage tasks. More specifically, they first proposed a multi-view clustering method to\r\ncluster the tickets into categories that both reflect the ticketed problems\r\nand are homogeneous in the duration time for an expert to solve them\r\nduring an expert’s solving process. Then they devised a data-informed\r\npolicy that assigns an incoming ticket to the expert who was the fastest\r\nin resolving it. In addition, Zeng et al. (2017) improved their method in Zeng et al.

To solve these\r\ntwo challenges, they proposed DeepCT, a GRU-based model with a\r\nrevised loss function and an attention-based mask strategy. DeepCT\r\ntakes the following data as its input: the incident attributes (titles\r\nand summaries), environment information (monitor ID, related devices,\r\nand how the incidents are reported), and the discussions (textual\r\ninformation written by engineers in an incremental manner).

Yu et al. 5.4. Incidentmitigation\r\nAfter a ticket is assigned, experts shall mitigate the incident quickly. Traditionally, experts try different mitigation actions (e.g., reboot the\r\nserver, replace the faulty hardware, or expand the hardware capacity)\r\nbased on their domain knowledge and analysis. However, manual anal-\r\nysis and mitigation exploration consume much time and prolong inci-\r\ndent recovery time. Thus, some researchers are committed to speeding\r\nup the mitigation process. In some organizations, experts record practical mitigation steps\r\nfor specific incidents. For example, experts of Microsoft record docu-\r\nments describing mitigation processes named troubleshooting guides\r\n(TSGs) (Jiang et al., 2020). Jiang et al. (2020) found incidents could\r\noccur repeatedly and TSGs could be reused to facilitate incident miti-\r\ngation. Therefore, they proposed an automated TSG recommendation\r\napproach, DeepRmd, leveraging the textual similarity between inci-\r\ndent description and its corresponding TSG based on deep learning\r\ntechniques. Intuitively, some incident linking methods in Section 5.2\r\ncan also find the best TSGs for current incidents by linking them with\r\nsimilar historical incidents. Furthermore, some works intend to provide automated solutions\r\nfor incident mitigation. Wu et al. (2012) proposed NetPilot, a system\r\nto automatically mitigate data center network failures by performing\r\nsimple actions, such as deactivating or restarting suspected failure\r\ncomponents. NetPilot circumvents the need for finding the exact root\r\ncause of a failure by taking an intelligent trial-and-error approach. NetPilot identifies a set of components that are likely to cause a prob-\r\nlem and iteratively takes mitigation actions targeting each one until\r\nthe problem is alleviated. The core of NetPilot comprises an impact\r\nestimator that helps prevent overly disruptive mitigation actions and a\r\nfailure-specific mitigation planner that minimizes the number of trials. Wang et al. (2018b) defined and formalized the automation recom-\r\nmendation procedure as a multiarmed bandit problem with dependent\r\narms.

Second, the ticket summaries and\r\nresolutions may be noisy, especially for manual tickets, so the non-\r\ninformative words lead to a low Jaccard similarity score of tickets\r\nwith similar resolutions, making Jaccard similarity function inappro-\r\npriate (Wang et al., 2017). Some works use several techniques to alleviate the first problem by\r\nutilizing semantic information for the similarity measure. Kang et al. (2010) presented a knowledge-rich similarity measure to automati-\r\ncally discover the most similar historical incidents for a new incident. This measure incorporates three types of information, i.e., incident\r\ndescription, expert groups, and incident classification, to improve the\r\ncapability of similarity measurement. Moreover, this measure exploits\r\nas much semantic knowledge as possible about various information\r\ncontained in previous incidents. Zhou et al. (2015b, 2016) proposed\r\ntwo approaches to improve the method in Tang et al. (2013a). On the\r\none hand, considering the resolutions often contain important infor-\r\nmation about incidents, they proposed a feature extraction approach\r\ncapable of representing both the descriptions and resolutions using\r\ntopic-level features obtained via the LDA model. On the other hand,\r\nconsidering that the effectiveness of KNN heavily relies on the under-\r\nlying similarity measurement, they improved similarity measurement\r\nusing metric learning. Zhou et al. (2015a) found out that vocabu-\r\nlaries used in ticket descriptions are changing and shifting over time,\r\nbut interesting mappings exist in those vocabularies. Then, they pro-\r\nposed a ticket resolution recommendation approach that accommodates\r\nvocabularies changing or shifting with time, based on a structural\r\ncorrespondence learning (SCL) domain adaptation algorithm. The aforementioned methods deal with only semantically similar\r\nwords without handling the noise caused by non-informative words. To\r\naddress the second problem, Wang et al. (2017) presented a domain-\r\nspecific approach to extract useful phrases to improve the resolution\r\nrecommendation. The approach is based on ontology modeling that can\r\nenhance the semantic understanding of tickets and de-noise tickets by\r\nfiltering non-informative words.

They conducted the data analysis to inspect the\r\nimpact and importance of different server attributes (i.e., hardware\r\nand OS type, hardware age, OS currency, as well as CPU and memory\r\nutilization) on the rates of server failures based on a large set of\r\nincident tickets and server attribute data. Then they summarized the\r\nkey conclusions, e.g., the hardware type and age highly impact server\r\nunavailability. These findings can further be used to derive guidelines\r\nfor technology refresh decisions of the data center. Giurgiu et al. (2014) conducted a large-scale study to analyze the\r\nfactors affecting the labor effort necessary to solve server incidents. The\r\nfactors include various incident features (i.e., the root cause, severity\r\nand complexity of the problem, the assigned support team, and the time\r\nshift when the incident is being resolved) and corresponding server\r\nfeatures (i.e., the machine age and architecture, as well as the OS type\r\nand currency). The results show that the nature of the incidents and\r\ntheir complexity, the assigned support groups, as well as the underlying\r\nOS type play a major role in how much labor effort is spent on resolving\r\nsuch tickets.

They also developed an industrial system based\r\non a set of data-driven techniques, addressing several significant chal-\r\nlenges in IcM practice, such as large-volume data, complex problem\r\nspace, and incomplete domain knowledge. Some works of Microsoft have analyzed incident characteristics\r\nfrom various perspectives. Chen et al. (2020a) analyzed incidents from\r\n18 online service systems and found that many incidents are incidental\r\nincidents, which do not matter and do not need to be fixed with\r\na high priority. Moreover, the incidental incidents are large-volume\r\nand cost much effort. So it is crucial to identify incidental incidents\r\nfor IcM effort reduction. Accordingly, they proposed a deep learning\r\nbased approach to prioritize incidents and find incidental incidents. Chen et al. (2020c) analyzed incident tickets from six core services\r\nin Microsoft, divided into four priorities (i.e., low, medium, high, and\r\ncritical). They found that (1) incidents with lower priority (low and\r\nmedium) are much more than incidents with higher priority (high\r\nand critical); (2) high-layer services (i.e., compute, database, and web\r\nservice) may have hierarchical root causes, which increases problem\r\nsearch space and incident fixing time; (3) network issue with hardware\r\nfailure and human error with code defect are the two major root causes\r\nfor all incidents. From the above descriptions, we can see that Microsoft usually\r\ntreats all alerts as incidents, so most of their works are claimed to focus\r\non analyzing incidents but not alerts, as shown in Table 4. In contrast,\r\nthis paper separates alert management and incident management. On\r\nthe one hand, it provides a more intuitive perspective to present each\r\nprocess and related works.

Mainchallenges\r\nWe summarize several major challenges in AIM as follows. 1.Large-volume and multi-source alerts.As shown in Fig. 1,\r\nlarge-scale IT service systems are complicated because of numer-\r\nous components and complex logical relationships (Zhao et al.,\r\n2020c). Alerts are multi-source as they can come from various\r\nindicators of each component at different levels. Moreover, a\r\nproblem of an individual component may affect a series of\r\ncomponents and their indicators (Jiang et al., 2011). Therefore,\r\nthe number of alerts may be enormous and far exceed what\r\nengineers can investigate manually (Tang et al., 2012).

This heterogeneity of incident tickets makes ticket\r\nanalysis more challenging. 4.Complex incident handling environments.Due to the com-\r\nplexity of services, multiple expert groups are needed to main-\r\ntain different service components (Chen et al., 2019b), such\r\nas networks, databases, and middleware.

Furthermore, although we concatenate the existing individual works\r\nof each module in our architecture (Fig. 2), these works still require\r\nhuman intervention. Alert correlation is a significant improvement\r\nin reducing manual analysis pressure. However, the results of alert\r\ncorrelation still need manual analysis to determine whether/how to\r\ncreate tickets.

Yu et al. 7.3.1. Optimizealertgeneration\r\nImprovealertgenerationbasedontheanalysisresultsofalerts\r\nand tickets.False/missed alerts, which cost much manual effort to\r\nhandle, are widespread in daily ITSM. On the one hand, it is because\r\nalert rules may not dynamically fit frequent fluctuations in the usage\r\nof IT services. On the other hand, originally suitable methods may be\r\ninapplicable as the service systems evolve. Thus, the alert generation\r\nneeds to be continuously optimized. As false/missed alerts often indicate inappropriate alerting rules,\r\noptimizing alerting generation based on the analysis results of alerts\r\nand tickets is very practical and valuable. But existing works mainly\r\nfocus on analyzing alerts after the alerts are generated. Only a few\r\nworks focus on optimizing alerting rules based on alert and incident\r\nanalysis. Tang et al. (2012) optimized alerting rules based on the\r\noffline analysis of historical alerts and the matching tickets, where\r\npotential monitoring conditions are built on a set of predictive rules\r\nautomatically generated by a rule-based learning algorithm with cov-\r\nerage, confidence, and rule complexity criteria. They also presented an\r\nintegrated framework to reduce false and missed alerts for an automatic\r\nmonitoring system (Tang et al., 2013c), mainly based on the finding\r\nthat many false-positive alerts were transient and could be cleared\r\nautomatically by waiting for some minutes. In fact, some existing techniques already provide support to op-\r\ntimize alerting rules. For example, some alert determination meth-\r\nods in Section 4.3 can identify false/non-severe alerts, which can\r\nbe further analyzed to optimize alerting rules. Identifying incidental\r\nincidents (Chen et al., 2020a) can help reduce false-positive alerts. Discovering manual tickets not reported by the monitoring system (Xu\r\net al., 2016) can help reduce missed alerts. Tang et al. (2013b) apply\r\na text classification model to analyze manual ticket descriptions and\r\nidentify the corresponding system issues, aiming to identify missed\r\nmonitoring alerts based on manual tickets.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"a4xHk3CtAf957KtLNNt0yhyFhxr7TVqyFAMgjhMSGys="},"5d5e4be9-0c70-45a4-8703-b8a50a0d2eab":{"id_":"5d5e4be9-0c70-45a4-8703-b8a50a0d2eab","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_18","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"9+0AnqDjBLbWQYY+a8Tab2KVbGN8sUxUhGAH4r9kkjI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"54debd09-7206-45ca-a8aa-3ca90bceabad","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"a4xHk3CtAf957KtLNNt0yhyFhxr7TVqyFAMgjhMSGys="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"819a0920-7d40-4dcf-adf3-7e61d56fa265","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"Z3uRnLzEUuUl4H78MhvLfGyuEZegQk0037/3Qb2PvHw="}},"text":"Moreover, some frequent or\r\nperiodic false alerts can be found by combining time sequence analysis\r\nmethods (Elfeky et al., 2005; Puech et al., 2019).

Although resolution recommenda-\r\ntion can help resolve current incidents, completing incident mitigation\r\nand resolution still costs much manual effort. Action recommendation\r\nsteps forward with more intelligent suggestions. While executing scripts\r\ncreated by experts achieves automatic mitigation in certain scenar-\r\nios (Wang et al., 2018b). More methods with more intelligence are still\r\nin need to reduce human effort and accelerate incident mitigation and\r\nresolution. 7.3.4. Develop/improveAIOpsframeworkforAIM\r\nAIOps, as one of the most important developments in service as-\r\nsurance in the last few years, has been commonly used in the trans-\r\nformation of modern service management systems. In general, most\r\nmodern AIM follow the AIOps strategies. As a result, some AIOps\r\nframeworks (Chen et al., 2020c; Li et al., 2022c; Gaikwad et al., 2021)\r\nfor AIM have been proposed in the literature. Besides, various AIOps\r\nproducts (e.g., moogsoft13) have been used in daily IT service opera-\r\ntions. They use many AIOps techniques to improve AIM performance.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"aFoySJmPeWFVks7X4Q6RB5tQYqvcG2TVfXa7c3oYkPg="},"909480a6-f481-41cb-9eb5-91d4dc88568d":{"id_":"909480a6-f481-41cb-9eb5-91d4dc88568d","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_19","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"uYZSzu9VgMgCb7y4tgdn1rM/q/JKo1wHrmhbaBsg3qg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3821dfea-3815-4d21-b9f9-113cc337eb1a","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"aFoySJmPeWFVks7X4Q6RB5tQYqvcG2TVfXa7c3oYkPg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0d1be45a-e0e3-4496-956b-9704a5f6a468","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"qS9mBPEjkWYkiFJggvU21F67rVrpIWbdicqyDeEL7dE="}},"text":"They use many AIOps techniques to improve AIM performance. In contrast, the techniques in our architecture seem to be the most\r\nsystematic and comprehensive. Our architecture can help improve the\r\nprocessing flow of the AIOps framework, and the technologies in each\r\nprocess can help improve the corresponding module. We believe this\r\nsurvey can facilitate the development of AIOps AIM systems. Besides, some works (e.g., Chen et al., 2022a; Arain et al., 2022) fo-\r\ncus on the efficiency of collaboration between operations roles because\r\nmultiple roles are required to view and process alerts and incidents\r\nfor large-scale IT service systems. These roles may have different duty\r\ntimes, current workloads, abilities, experiences, etc. Therefore, the op-\r\ntimization of role collaboration is required for the operations of large-\r\nscale service systems. But the related works are not much introduced\r\nin our survey. 7.4. Relatedtechnologies\r\nThis paper is a survey of research papers on the topic of AIM,\r\nfocusing on related algorithms. Relevant papers rarely introduce details\r\nor specific techniques in engineering practice. Therefore, we present\r\nsome insights into related technologies based on practical experience\r\nin our real-world AIOps. 13https://www.moogsoft.com. 7.4.1. Programminglanguages\r\nIn AIOps practice, the most commonly used language for developing\r\nAIM tools and systems should be Java which has a complete ecosystem. Some important applications, such as Flink,14are mainly developed\r\nbased on the Java language. Besides, the Scala language is another\r\nwidely used language for development practice these years. Scala has\r\nbeen used in important applications, such as Spark,15a big data process-\r\ning framework, and Kafka,16a distributed publish/subscribe system. Scala is suitable for the development of big data, data mining, NLP,\r\nmachine learning, etc. These two languages are widely used because\r\nlarge-scale streaming processing is essential in alert processing. Mixed\r\nprogramming development in Java and Scala would be an excellent\r\nchoice for developers. In addition, in related research fields, the Python language is widely\r\nused to implement various algorithm prototypes quickly as it is easy to\r\nunderstand and learn and has many algorithm libraries. 7.4.2.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"S/0ZLxUAE/Hpao5cGIyQllE1qlmrhKXVmHsjswZPGcE="},"0d1be45a-e0e3-4496-956b-9704a5f6a468":{"id_":"0d1be45a-e0e3-4496-956b-9704a5f6a468","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_19","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"uYZSzu9VgMgCb7y4tgdn1rM/q/JKo1wHrmhbaBsg3qg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"909480a6-f481-41cb-9eb5-91d4dc88568d","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"S/0ZLxUAE/Hpao5cGIyQllE1qlmrhKXVmHsjswZPGcE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8df99ad2-98ed-4625-b0b7-d044c3d5abb7","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"i70ux69q/4fCK/WBFYNRdMZe7dCnjybhtjcPq9eDIVE="}},"text":"7.4.2. Open-sourcetools\r\nIn AIOps practice, several open-source tools can be used to achieve\r\nvarious goals. Grafana17is an open-source data visualization tool with\r\nrich dashboards and charts. It can visualize various data and support\r\nmultiple data sources, such as Graphite, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, Mysql,\r\netc. Grafana allows users to configure thresholds and conditions for\r\nreceiving alerts. And alert notifications can be received through Pager-\r\nDuty, Slack, Webhooks, and Gmail. Therefore, Grafana can be used to\r\ndisplay various metrics, alerts, incidents, etc. Some system monitoring tools, such as Prometheus18and Zab-\r\nbix, can be exploited. The main difference between them is that the\r\ndatabase used by Prometheus is the time series database TSDB, and\r\nthe database used by Zabbix is the relational database of MySQL or\r\nPgSQL. Therefore, Prometheus is more suitable for time series data such\r\nas metrics, and Zabbix is more suitable for storing data such as logs. Flink is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful\r\ncomputations over unbounded and bounded data streams. It is very\r\naccurate in data ingestion and can easily recover from failures while\r\nmaintaining the state. Flink can be used with Kafka to transmit metrics,\r\nalerts, and other data efficiently. In our current AIM practices, we use big data components (e.g.,\r\nFlink) to generate, process, and distribute alerts in real time. However,\r\nwe rarely use big data or high-performance computing components\r\nwhen conducting AIOps alert analyses (e.g., alert storm analysis). This\r\nis because the amount of alerts and incidents is relatively small com-\r\npared to various monitoring metrics. However, as the scale of the\r\nservice system continues to expand, the volume of alerts and incidents\r\nmay exceed the current single-machine analysis capability. Therefore,\r\nhigh-performance computing and big data components (e.g., Hadoop19\r\nand Spark) can be widely used in future alert and incident analysis. 8. Conclusion\r\nThis paper has reviewed the research works carried out in intel-\r\nligent AIM in IT services. First of all, for a unified description and\r\nbetter understanding, the paper summarizes an architecture of AIM. Then, a detailed literature review is conducted based on corresponding\r\nprocesses in the architecture.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qS9mBPEjkWYkiFJggvU21F67rVrpIWbdicqyDeEL7dE="},"8df99ad2-98ed-4625-b0b7-d044c3d5abb7":{"id_":"8df99ad2-98ed-4625-b0b7-d044c3d5abb7","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_19","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"uYZSzu9VgMgCb7y4tgdn1rM/q/JKo1wHrmhbaBsg3qg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0d1be45a-e0e3-4496-956b-9704a5f6a468","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"qS9mBPEjkWYkiFJggvU21F67rVrpIWbdicqyDeEL7dE="}},"text":"Then, a detailed literature review is conducted based on corresponding\r\nprocesses in the architecture.

The current cybersecurity paradigm suggests that\r\nany organization can have cyberattacks anytime, regardless of the\r\nsecurity principles applied. Therefore, the preparation/readiness\r\nphase  is  vitally  essential  to  respond  to  these  attacks  adequately. We  first  identified  a  report  on  major  cybersecurity  incidents\r\nthat  is  compiled  by  the  Center  for  Strategic  &  International\r\nStudies, from which we examined major cybersecurity incidents,\r\nand   we   then   established   its   credibility,   non-partisan,   global\r\noutreach,  and  attack  coverage  by  cross-referencing  it  with  Data\r\nBreach  Investigation  Report  (DBIR). Given  this  context,  this\r\nstudy  conducts  a  systematic  literature  review  to  understand  the\r\nbody  of  knowledge  that  highlights  administrative  and  technical\r\ncapabilities of organizations to respond to a likely cybersecurity\r\nattack. Study  findings  show  that  about  72  percent  of  surveyed\r\npapers  suggest  that  more  organizations  embrace  administrative\r\ncapabilities,  especially  compared  to  technical  skills. More  orga-\r\nnizations also recognize the importance of having Cybersecurity\r\nIncident  Response  Team  (CSIRT)  abilities  to  enhance  readiness\r\nto combat potential cybersecurity incidents - this is validated by\r\nthe 88.89 percent score identified in this study. We emphasize the\r\nsignificance of organizations’ readiness to conduct cybersecurity\r\nincident  triage  and  or  thorough  investigation  based  on  the  fact\r\nthat  major  incidents  will  always  occur  as  we  validated  in  this\r\nstudy.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"luJthF9aJt8+m9ZAgPmVDQEYOLXfYCRiHPKDPE55g2k="},"1f5c7efb-95bf-4a0c-9f45-2464c64782e3":{"id_":"1f5c7efb-95bf-4a0c-9f45-2464c64782e3","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"PoW5ZlDRx1T2+ugtGsoVwBqvg6P5xbbncXIKmTe7eBo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"826e2ab5-51ae-4be7-b7e2-a0767b872f2f","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"luJthF9aJt8+m9ZAgPmVDQEYOLXfYCRiHPKDPE55g2k="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4450f05c-1c9c-4ffd-9f15-3136882a9a50","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"/Yos5O43UBXmNYOrciM0WFLxl+DvtIwyqjN05//j0Sw="}},"text":"As  a  result,  using  the  National  Institute  of  Standards\r\nand  Technology  (NIST)  framework  as  an  example,  we  suggest\r\nthat  organizations  should  determine  which  stages  of  the  NIST\r\nframework  are  applicable.

The general overview of cybersecurity incidents\r\nfrom 2005 to 2022 shows that many incidents have impacted\r\nvarious organizations in different regions of the world [2], [3],\r\n[4]. The  likelihood  of  a  cybersecurity  incident  occurring  in\r\nany  organization  is  a  fact. Therefore,  any  small,  medium,  or\r\nlarge organization must have the proper cybersecurity incident\r\ndetection and response capabilities to deal with it if or when\r\nit happens [5].","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"G8H1k9PJWe6Kg1fcUTu13xHs1Fkd70+9nW0c0orOvu4="},"4450f05c-1c9c-4ffd-9f15-3136882a9a50":{"id_":"4450f05c-1c9c-4ffd-9f15-3136882a9a50","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"PoW5ZlDRx1T2+ugtGsoVwBqvg6P5xbbncXIKmTe7eBo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1f5c7efb-95bf-4a0c-9f45-2464c64782e3","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"G8H1k9PJWe6Kg1fcUTu13xHs1Fkd70+9nW0c0orOvu4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"09f60711-269c-487a-bf76-ce40dcfdf3cb","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"CMPF+C5zrnTjkrBeD2yyt+J3h5iceBsP2ZIbDlPx/Lk="}},"text":"Cybersecurity incident detection and response\r\ncapabilities often require the combination of human resources,\r\nsecurity  systems,  information  technology  infrastructure,  and\r\nprocesses  to  be  in  place  for  a  practical  readiness  to  respond\r\nto  an  incident  when  it  occurs  [6].

BACKGROUNDLITERATURE\r\nNo  organization,  including  small,  medium,  and  big  busi-\r\nnesses  and  government  institutions,  is  safe  from  today’s  so-\r\nphisticated  cyberattacks,  even  those  with  the  highest  or  most\r\nrobust security controls in place [14]. When these cyberattacks\r\nare successfully launched to cause adverse consequences to a\r\ntargeted entity, it becomes a cybersecurity incident [19]. Given\r\nthat  cybersecurity  incidents  can  be  compared  to  emergencies\r\nthat  may  have  catastrophic  repercussions,  the  longer  they\r\nare  ignored  or  improperly  controlled,  the  more  severe  the\r\nresults  will  be  [20]. These  aforementioned  premises  echo\r\nthe  importance  of  having  a  prepared  incident  management\r\ncapability  in  place. While  having  an  incident  management\r\nprotocol is very important, it is even more significant to ensure\r\nthat it is well tested [21]. A. Administrative Capabilities\r\nIn  this  section,  we  highlight  some  of  the  administrative\r\ncontrols that organizations employ or at least think about when\r\npreparing for or handling a cybersecurity incident. The list here\r\nis not exhaustive but at least summarizes some of our findings\r\nfrom the literature that we surveyed in this study:\r\n1)  Communication:Projecting  a  positive  outlook  and  en-\r\nsuring effective but transparent public communication during\r\nincident  handling  tends  to  calm  not  just  the  stakeholders\r\nbut  may  also  stabilize  the  market  forces  as  well  [22]. This\r\nsuggests the importance of a communication policy that does\r\nnot only provide coverage for external but internal audiences\r\nas  well. Having  a  policy  drafted  and  approved  may  not\r\nbe  enough. Policy  enforcement  is  also  crucial  for  effective\r\ncommunication  during  handling  of  an  incident  [23].","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Yv5g/jvBAxMFZfZrSHX2Wigy6DMBjGQGtSvtOdzb8tw="},"9571d44e-e0db-47c6-bcaa-868290629a7d":{"id_":"9571d44e-e0db-47c6-bcaa-868290629a7d","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"S3OSf2cheeYXJ6KuHXYQOuc+GEbkULUpho1aGBq+Kvg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"dfe807d1-3c2b-4087-9b78-3867bab26836","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"Yv5g/jvBAxMFZfZrSHX2Wigy6DMBjGQGtSvtOdzb8tw="}},"text":"Given\r\nhow  in  “today’s  cyber  threat  landscape,  a  wide  variety  of\r\nskills  and  coordination  are  needed  to  combat  increasingly\r\ncomplex challenge” [24], leveraging an effective internal and\r\nexternal communication during the handling of a cybersecurity\r\nincident  may  be  valuable  towards  addressing  the  identified\r\ncyber threats. 2)  Information Sharing:Having the necessary information\r\nsharing strategy in place and effectively executing such strat-\r\negy, whether it is prior the occurrence of a major security event\r\nor during an active cybersecurity incident management, is very\r\ncrucial towards ensuring that all parties are kept informed in\r\nthe  prior,  during  and  post  stages  of  any  given  cybersecurity\r\nincident  [20],  [25],  [26],  [24],  [27],  [28].

Beyond  an  organization’s  inter-\r\nnal  communication,  it  is  also  very  important  to  highlight\r\nhow  information  sharing  can  enhance  cybersecurity  incident\r\nresponse  on  a  global  scale  by  ensuring  the  reduction  of\r\ndisparity of cybersecurity information that is available among\r\ncountries  and  organizations  [27]. Therefore,  national  govern-\r\nments,  industries,  businesses,  and  organizations,  as  well  as\r\nindividual end users of digital devices, share responsibility for\r\ncybersecurity information sharing  [25]. It suffices  to say that\r\nnation states often coordinate shared cyber defense obligations\r\nin order to build capacities to achieve cyber resilience, lower\r\ncybercrime, and secure crucial national infrastructure [25]. 3)  Training:An organization’s “information assets leak out\r\ndue to employees’ careless behavior, for instance, downloading\r\nemails  sent  by  an  unidentified  sender,  checking  linked-pages\r\nincautiously  or  setting  passwords  by  their  own  birthdays”\r\n[29], hence it is very important that the necessary investments\r\nare  made,  with  the  right  programs  designed  to  ensure  the\r\nimplementation of information security training and education\r\nfor  employees  [29]. Also,  given  that  the  global  information\r\ntechnology  skills  shortages  have  surpassed  four  million,  one\r\nof  the  identified  remedies  is  for  organizations  to  take  a  look\r\ninward and strengthen the cross-training of existing informa-\r\ntion  technology  professionals  where  possible  [30]. Incorpo-\r\nrating  information  security  into  some  of  these  cross-training\r\nprograms may also alleviate some of the challenges posed by\r\na lack of cybersecurity education.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"MsyiVfLNbVPbs1Ij36XbUMr7PByzmOO/VJNejXji5x8="},"4a3a9a7b-d1f3-488c-8edd-7574c57ec531":{"id_":"4a3a9a7b-d1f3-488c-8edd-7574c57ec531","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf_3","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"WqI4FjqJQP2pJDh6L4fxclTHwoL2C8nvIG8pURLFA9E="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"961dc933-38fd-4ed5-bf84-9abdfbe7f619","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"MsyiVfLNbVPbs1Ij36XbUMr7PByzmOO/VJNejXji5x8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c85d558d-5eff-4609-bb39-210b25f31002","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"RHg63H7pVHtv3upQL194L91gR9GccOZFMoyKnebyBBM="}},"text":"A routine tabletop exercise\r\nis one of the best ways to get ready for handling a significant\r\ncybersecurity event since it raises the knowledge, comprehen-\r\nsion,  and  readiness  of  cybersecurity  incident  response  teams\r\n[21]. 4)  Policies,  Processes,  Procedure  and  Standard  Frame-\r\nworks  (PPP  &  SF):Having  an  enterprise  incident  response\r\npolicy,  well  documented  processes,  clear  procedure,  defined\r\nstandards  and  other  relevant  artifacts  in  place  as  part  of\r\nthe  effort  to  ensure  readiness  for  a  potential  cybersecurity\r\nincident  is  fundamentally  a  necessary  foundation  for  an  ef-\r\nfective  incident  management  and  if  well  enforced,  could  not\r\nonly  ensure  adequate  response  during  incident  handling  but\r\nmay  also  prevent  a  disastrous  fiasco  [31],  [32],  [33].

VI. CONCLUSION\r\nApart from looking at the Significant Incident Report pub-\r\nlished by the Center for Strategic & International Studies [2],\r\nwe also extensively cross-reference the Data Breach Incident\r\nReports [15], [16], [17], [18] in order to validate some of the\r\nnotable security events, from which we drew the introduction\r\nof this paper. As we write this conclusion, one surprise in our\r\nreviewed literature was the emphasis placed on automation as\r\none of the technical capabilities considered in this study. This\r\nfactor scored the lowest mark, accepting a ‘Yes’ of 39 percent\r\namong the literature reviewed. This result is ironic considering\r\nthe huge budget most organizations allocate for automation (as\r\nwell as other technical capabilities) of security infrastructures\r\non yearly basis [67], [68], [69], [70]. It might be necessary at\r\nthis stage to ask why organizations allocate significant budgets\r\nfor  technical  capabilities  that  have  been  proved  in  this  paper\r\nto  be  less  potent  than  administrative  factors  when  building\r\neffective cybersecurity defense systems. Human factors play crucial role in formation of an adequate\r\nrisk management [71], [72]. Most of the concerns associated\r\nwith  human  factors  are  usually  addressed  through  adequate\r\ngovernance that relies heavily on effective policies, processes,\r\nand procedures [73], [74], [75]. This result further emphasizes\r\nvarious works that have proved human factor as a major flaw\r\nor  weak  link  that  must  be  continuously  emphasized  to  build\r\na resilient system. Hence the supporting results of 77 percent\r\nresult for training as one of the key capabilities. Also looking at the data analyzed in this paper, combining\r\nthis  with  our  decades  of  experience  in  information  security,\r\nrisk  management,  and  governance,  we  also  opined  that  the\r\nresults  are  complementary.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"PNofu/Y6RhjrkvLcTySKfjDNSL4xJXj6qjEr6OeeOzo="},"753fc20d-dc7a-4c1b-a59b-747b629c6cfc":{"id_":"753fc20d-dc7a-4c1b-a59b-747b629c6cfc","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf_8","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"iADJakOcJB9MaOnudxVckN1iuBCuTmmim4wLkIQ6dXE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"49bd6e01-9128-4f6e-ad56-0d9aad9295de","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"PNofu/Y6RhjrkvLcTySKfjDNSL4xJXj6qjEr6OeeOzo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d9e5f3e1-2790-4da0-bb46-d0c93c943679","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"3S/EdPLFTq9fcxN/2JTvv1VjxIdZ0+eyHVtdCPtZ/7g="}},"text":"One  of  the  major  game  changers\r\nin  the  security  space  in  the  last  two  decades  is  the  emer-\r\ngence  of  security  automation  systems  that  enable  security\r\nprofessionals to simultaneously scan logs of security incidents\r\nacross infrastructures [76], [77]. These measures are humanly\r\nimpossible  to  achieve,  and  they  underpin  the  importance  of\r\nsecurity architecture. We expect technical tools of this nature to continue to play\r\nsignificant  roles  amid  the  advent  of  more  sophisticated  tech-\r\nnology  such  as  Augmented  Reality,  Virtual  Reality,  Internet\r\nof  Things,  Blockchain,  etc. However,  this  paper  emphasizes\r\nthe need for emerging technical capabilities to be adequately\r\nsupported  with  sufficient  administrative  tools.

However, the\r\nlogical steps in filtering the literature have enabled us to come\r\nto  a  reasonable  conclusion  regarding  key  capabilities  orga-\r\nnizations  must  possess  to  respond  to  and  treat  cybersecurity\r\nincidents effectively.

Potential Size bias\r\nIt  is  pertinent  to  state  that  while  primary  publications\r\nreviewed for purpose of this study provided empirical content\r\non   security   incidents   management,   there   is   no   consistent\r\nevidence that suggested or provided hints on specific sizes of\r\norganizations  considered  under  their  research  works. While\r\non  one  hand  among  OECD  countries,  Small  and  medium-\r\nsized entities account for 95 percent of businesses - controlling\r\na  significant  portion  of  economic  activities  [81],  [82]  and\r\nthey also constitute vast majority of businesses in the United\r\nStates  of  America  as  well  [83];  on  the  other  hand,  mostly\r\nit  is  big-size  organizations  that  adopt  significant  technical\r\ncapabilities  such  as  automation  or  CSIRT  or  SOC  as  part\r\nof  their  security  management  system  due  to  the  huge  budget\r\nrequired,  besides  small-size  firms  that  leverage  security-as-a-\r\nservice to achieve similar fit. Considering the huge population\r\nof  small  and  medium-sized  firms,  it  is  possible  then  that\r\nempirical inputs from most papers we surveyed could be size-\r\nbiased and invariably our output could have favored less costly\r\ncapabilities such as administrative measures (such as policies,\r\nframeworks, training etc). Therefore, we assert the possibility\r\nthat the low score achieved by capabilities such as automation\r\nand SOC could result from this size bias. VIII. FURTHERSTUDY\r\nIn response to the size bias mentioned under the limitations\r\nsection,  we  also  recommend  further  research  to  investigate\r\npossible roles sizes of organizations could play in determining\r\nthe  appropriate  capabilities  necessary  for  building  resilient\r\ncybersecurity  incident  response  systems. While  it  appears  to\r\nbe common knowledge that budget plays a crucial role in an\r\norganization’s choice of capability, cybersecurity systems can\r\nbe optimized within a given context of the organization’s size.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"KGFbl4C6e9lho2PwCwsAvi/cW4l2yttigc1KhXC60Bg="},"ee2d0f1e-491f-4d16-8d25-4ff060becb29":{"id_":"ee2d0f1e-491f-4d16-8d25-4ff060becb29","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf_9","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"mPUs998wjchUSagNwgRXbi2uwIixOzZ5cLPuN7dYwg8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"70b04fc7-1b78-4b75-b734-ab3e014a337f","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"KGFbl4C6e9lho2PwCwsAvi/cW4l2yttigc1KhXC60Bg="}},"text":"The  work  for  further  research  would  therefore  need  to  focus\r\non  optimizing  appropriate  capabilities  for  a  given  financial\r\ncapacity of the firm to eliminate size bias from such a study.

When such cyber attacks occur,\r\ne.g. a ransomware outbreak, it is desirable to quickly respond by\r\ncontaining the threat or limit its consequences. Technologies that\r\nsupport this process have been widely used for decades, including\r\nantivirus software and deep-packet inspection firewalls. A large\r\nnumber of researches on cyber security have been initiated to auto-\r\nmate the incident handling process further, often motivated by the\r\nneed to respond to more advanced cyber attacks or the increasing\r\ncyber risks at stake. This paper reviews the research on automatic\r\nincident response solutions published since the year 2000, in order\r\nto identify gaps as well as guide further research. The proposed\r\nsolutions are categorized in terms of the input they use (e.g. in-\r\ntrusion signals) and the output they perform (e.g. reconfiguring a\r\nnetwork) using the D3FEND framework. The solutions presented\r\nin 45 papers published in the academic literature are analyzed and\r\ncompared to four commercially available solutions for automatic\r\nresponse. Many of the 45 papers described input and output in\r\nvague terms. The most common inputs were from asset inventories,\r\nplatform monitoring and network traffic analysis. The most com-\r\nmon output was network isolation measures, e.g. to reconfigure\r\nfirewalls. Commercially available solutions focus more on looking\r\nfor identifiers in reputation systems and individual analyzing files.

Tools that offer support and\r\nprovide system administrators and incident handlers with situa-\r\ntional awareness receive a considerable portion of these resources. These tools enable faster and more efficient responses to be exe-\r\ncuted. They also enable automation of incident response processes. This paper focuses on such automated incident response. To automate incident response processes is, for many reasons,\r\nbeneficial and desirable. Automation can reduce the need of expen-\r\nsive and scarce human resources as well as lead to better, quicker\r\nand more reliable responses to threats. Accordingly, incident re-\r\nsponse technologies that automate parts of the incident response\r\nprocess are already present in many organizations. For example,\r\nantivirus software, email filters, and advanced firewalls systems\r\nautomate things previously requiring human resources. Antivirus\r\nsoftware use signatures and heuristics to block suspicious files or\r\nprocesses that are present on endpoints in the network; email filters\r\ntry to recognize phishing emails and drop or block them; advanced\r\nfirewalls may inspect traffic in the application layer and block or\r\ndrop traffic if it is associated with threats.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"az1yk8EJcbw0dv0lnPhgLbsNZWqD/9xi7zeiHuAj1JI="},"6dd2b4f7-ba2c-44f9-bd9a-87987eac82ef":{"id_":"6dd2b4f7-ba2c-44f9-bd9a-87987eac82ef","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"8XLMuCV6rSBv46MOA368wg43/tzdM4/pQ347TiLVJxc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7b5fcb5f-1272-419d-98e0-d85bc19971e3","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"az1yk8EJcbw0dv0lnPhgLbsNZWqD/9xi7zeiHuAj1JI="}},"text":"However, despite their\r\nutility, the incident response technologies used today are unable to\r\nrespond to all threats organizations face. First, some threats may be difficult to identify unless logs from\r\nmultiple machines and network devices are correlated and com-\r\nbined. For instance, an unusual email may need to be correlated with\r\nunusual host events and suspicious network traffic to be classified\r\nas phishing with enough certainty. Centralized log management\r\nsystems, often referred to as security information event manage-\r\nment (SIEM) systems, enable the correlation of different events in a\r\ncomputer network. A considerable body of research is available on\r\nlog analysis and log correlation of relevance to SIEM systems [19]\r\n[15]. For instance, many solutions correlate alerts using models of\r\nthe steps attackers may take [15]. Second, some responses may require coordination of different\r\ndevices and security components in a network. For instance, a\r\nphishing email may warrant both blocking of the sender in the\r\nlocal email server and blocking malicious links in the network fire-\r\nwall. Means of executing pre-prepared “playbooks” that activate\r\ndefenses, addresses this problem. These executions are often real-\r\nized by security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR)\r\nsystems. The scholarly literature is not as extensive and deep when\r\nit comes to the construction of playbooks that respond to networks\r\nattacks. However, best practices for incident handling have been\r\nestablished [18][6], and various ways of specifying responses have\r\nbeen proposed [24]. For example, the language OpenC2 defines ac-\r\ntions (e.g. “deny”) and targets (e.g. “domain_name”) that are relevant\r\n[16].

More specifi-\r\ncally, they may be leveraged to correlate multiple weak intrusion\r\nsignals, and deploy an appropriate response that involves multiple\r\ndefenses. Consequently, several large initiatives have been taken\r\nalong this direction, e.g. the European Defence Fund call “Cyber\r\nthreat intelligence and improved cyber operational capabilities”, the\r\nUK initiative for “Autonomous Resilient Cyber Defence” and the\r\nDARPA call for “Cyber Agents for Security Testing and Learning”. This paper aims to summarize solutions on automatic and semi-\r\nautomatic incident response as described in the scholarly literature\r\nsince the year 2000, and to analyse these solutions in relation to the\r\nplaybooks of available incident response products. As illustrated in\r\nFigure 1, a black box perspective is employed, and the internal logic\r\nof the solutions is not addressed as long as it is (semi-) automatic. Instead, the solutions are classified based on what input data they\r\nuse, what responses they choose from, and how these two relate to\r\nactions of available products. More specifically, the paper answers\r\nthe following research questions:\r\n•Which input data (signals, system information, intelligence,\r\netc. ) are used in proposed solutions for automated incident\r\nresponse? •Which actions (reconfigurations, probes, denylists, etc. ) are\r\nused in proposed solutions for automated incident response? •How does the input and output covered in academic papers\r\ncompare with the playbooks of available products? The answers to these questions can help identify gaps in the\r\ncurrent research, e.g. whether research has focused on only some\r\ninputs and outputs, and whether other issues are of relevance in\r\npractice. Assuming that the published research covers relevant in-\r\ncident handling procedures, the answer to the first question should\r\ninform SIEM developers on what data they should include in their\r\nsolutions, while the second question should inform SOAR develop-\r\ners on what actions their solutions should be capable of executing.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"gz66xvtmrqfsjXzREG0SD+0kli+2g8XBZju5ByJN3Dc="},"ce732b23-4e32-48bc-8060-03b69e31f478":{"id_":"ce732b23-4e32-48bc-8060-03b69e31f478","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"XNxsruB5KvE/zb7LL+MB0jaSYeANMhtcs9PchIM5PE8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d780e612-e1ce-4236-8859-1c6c89284a06","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"gz66xvtmrqfsjXzREG0SD+0kli+2g8XBZju5ByJN3Dc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e44c5392-ffb7-45a7-a680-ce3f8942c0e0","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"ObULekfddsJA9F88vOnH/Ay2ijKLa3WF8xNdKGy7JwI="}},"text":"In addition, while the answers to these two questions scope the\r\nproblem of automated responses through the lens of academic re-\r\nsearch, the answer to the third question ought to indicate the gap\r\nbetween the research and current practice. Ultimately, the answers\r\nto the three research questions can assist in developing better au-\r\ntomatic and semi-automatic incident response solutions that can\r\nhelp organizations deal with cyber attacks. A number of literature reviews have covered topics related to au-\r\ntomated responses. This includes reviewing research on recommen-\r\ndation systems for cybersecurity incident handling and response\r\n[8], machine learning in relation to SOAR systems [13], and the\r\nrelationship between threat intelligence and intrusion responses\r\n[7]. Papers that address the input and output of automatic response\r\nsolutions are also available. In particular, [1] reviewed and catego-\r\nrized commercial intrusion response solutions and assessed which\r\ninput and output (i.e. responses) they used. Both input and output\r\nwere assessed on a high level of abstraction. Input was categorized\r\nas network input, host input, or input from a SIEM system. Re-\r\nsponses were classified as proactive (three types), reactive (four\r\ntypes), and passive (six types). The review in [1] answers the first\r\ntwo research questions of our paper, but is at a higher level of ab-\r\nstraction, and without papers published since 2010. Another more\r\nrecent review is presented in [2]. This review focuses mostly on\r\ndifferent types of input and detection schemas. It provides a list of\r\nintrusion responses that are said to be common, with 18 types of\r\nresponses (e.g. “enable remote logging” and “lock user account”). It\r\nis unclear how it was determined that these are common. A third,\r\neven more recent, review is presented in [3].

As recommended in [14][20] for systematic literature\r\nreviews, the following is covered: how research was identified\r\n(Section 2.1), how inclusion criteria were applied (Section 2.2), how\r\ndata were extracted and mapped (Section 2.3), and how the extracted\r\ndata were synthesized (Section 2.4). Additionally, the scholarly data\r\nwere compared to the functionality of available products (Section\r\n2.5). 2.1  Study identification\r\nInitially, manual searches were conducted to identify papers with\r\nclear relevance to the topic. Keywords such as SOAR and “automatic\r\nincident handling” were used. Upon review of the resulting papers\r\nand papers cited in these papers, the following search string was\r\nidentified as suitable:\r\n( \"intrusion response\"  OR  \"cyber response\"\r\nOR  \"incident response\"  OR  \"incident handling\"","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ObULekfddsJA9F88vOnH/Ay2ijKLa3WF8xNdKGy7JwI="},"d19751c2-9ad3-4bd4-8ac9-108cb7d0d6cc":{"id_":"d19751c2-9ad3-4bd4-8ac9-108cb7d0d6cc","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf_3","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"JihGKaMnM+kIunizUZ6y9bBTn1rWocTsjMgu8qG4Kns="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"67bbb07c-b830-4f79-a287-aa927d32965e","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"IFnb87n0eTHxuBgGkv86opf7ffex8k5Riyn5LinQ4qI="}},"text":"Automatic incident response solutions: a review of proposed solutions’ input and output                                              ARES 2023, August 29–September 01, 2023, Benevento, Italy\r\nOR \"security orchestration, automation and response\" )\r\nAND ( auto* )  AND ( cyber*  OR  network ).

Two measures for input were used because most papers focused\r\non a limited part of the problem, and these two types of input\r\ncover differ parts of the problem and received different amount\r\nof attention in the papers. Few papers covered input and output\r\nthoroughly, and only seven papers scored more than three on the\r\nscale on each of the three parts. A total score of six (of maximum\r\n27) was set as a threshold for inclusion. This resulted in 45 papers\r\nto be included in the review. Remaining papers, not meeting this\r\ncriterion, were superficial and presented early ideas or focused\r\nsolely on part of the problem (e.g. describing potential responses\r\nwithout describing input). The 45 papers were assessed as being of\r\nreasonable quality, and as a whole constituting a reasonable amount\r\nof papers from which to extract data.

A number of alternatives were consid-\r\nered for these categorizations. For input, categorizations used in\r\nother research (e.g. the ones in [1], [2] and [24]) and well-known\r\ndata schemas (e.g. Splunk’s Common information model and STIX)\r\nwere considered. For output, schemas proposed for SOAR systems\r\nwere considered (e.g. OpenC2 [16] and CACAO [4]). However, none\r\nof these was found to be ideal for classifying input or output. For\r\ninstance, Splunk’s model is too detailed, while OpenC2 lacks com-\r\nmon actions (e.g. the disabling of user accounts). This review found\r\nMITRE’s D3FEND framework [11], a catalog of defensive cyber-\r\nsecurity techniques, to be suitable for classifying the solutions,\r\nand used version 0.12.0-BETA-2 of D3FEND.

To\r\nillustrate this, Figure 2 outlines the sub-techniques of Network\r\nIsolation. The extraction was performed by reading the included papers\r\nand classifying any mentioned input and output using D3FEND. In\r\nmany cases, this was trivial. For instance, outputs that block exter-\r\nnal hosts using firewalls were mapped toIsolate-Network Isolation-\r\nNetwork Traffic Filtering-Inbound Traffic Filtering(tactic – technique\r\n– sub-technique – sub-sub-technique). In other cases, some interpre-\r\ntation was needed. For example, when the solution in [12] responds\r\nto brute force guessing on SSH, this was classified asDetect-Network\r\nTraffic Analysis-Administrative Network Activity Analysisbased on\r\nthe context given in the paper. Another example is when the solu-\r\ntion responded to unspecified output from Snort, as in [10], where\r\nthe detection was classified only on the highest technique-level\r\n(Detect-Network Traffic Analysis) because of the lack of detail. A\r\nnote was made when the classification required some interpretation. A note was also made when the input or output of the solution fell\r\noutside the scope of D3FEND. For example, D3FEND does not have\r\na response switching over to redundant service, which is discussed\r\nin [22]. For a full list of the extracted D3FEND techniques from\r\neach paper, see Appendix. 2.4  Synthesis\r\nThe extraction form based on the D3FEND techniques allowed\r\nfor a straightforward analysis of the papers. The proportion of\r\npapers using the different techniques for inputs and outputs were\r\ncalculated to answer the first two research questions. Because of\r\nthe high abstraction level in the papers, each paper was associated\r\nwith at most one use of a particular technique, and the highest level\r\nof abstraction in D3FEND was used for comparison.

Network Isolation is highly\r\ncommon both in papers and playbooks, but less so in playbooks. A few playbooks were difficult to relate to D3FEND. More specif-\r\nically, playbooks to restart services, restart machines, and reimage\r\nmachines were found in the repositories. Additionally, the commer-\r\ncial playbooks frequently use different types of data enrichment,\r\nwhich is not the case in the papers. Approximately a quarter of\r\nthe playbooks focus on enriching data, e.g. by looking up threat\r\nintelligence and combining data from systems in order to present\r\nthe synthesized result to a human operator. 4  DISCUSSION\r\nThe discussion below discusses the homogeneity and maturity of\r\nthe research (Section 4.1), the relationships between input data and\r\noutput (Section 4.2), as well as the validity and reliability of this\r\nreview (Section 4.3). 4.1  Homogeneity and maturity of the research\r\nAs described above, the solutions described in the literature cover\r\na wide range of inputs and responses, with clear differences be-\r\ntween them. Alternatives to this heterogeneity and variation would\r\nhave been possible. For instance, the research community could\r\nhave collectively focused on a particular problem of dealing with a\r\ncompromised machine, agreed on the type of input and output to\r\nwork with, and researched techniques for these inputs and outputs. Clearly, this is not how the research community has acted. One\r\npossibility is that researchers have tried to defend against differ-\r\nent cyber attacks, due to differing domains or due to evolutions\r\nof attacks and available defenses (inputs and outputs) over time.

It is also difficult to say\r\nmuch about differences between the inputs and outputs over time,\r\nnot least since the publication levels were very low before 2016.

For example, a solution that analyses prop-\r\nerties of emails in order to detect phishing, will be able to block\r\nsuspicious domains easily but be poorly equipped to lock accounts\r\nthat were compromised by the phishing email if no data linking\r\nthe email to accounts is available. On the conceptual level, the pa-\r\npers discuss these links. However, as the lack of proof-of-concept\r\ndemonstrations suggests, many papers provide vague descriptions\r\nand make little effort to make these links clear. For instance, the\r\ninputs needed to determine if a particular action should be taken\r\nare largely missing. Additionally, this review treats the automated\r\ndecision techniques as a black box. In other words, this review disre-\r\ngards the approach a paper’s solution chooses a response based on\r\nan input, as long as the approach is semi-automated or automated. As such, it is out of scope for this review to consider whether there\r\nare particularities depending on the decision model, e.g. if some\r\nlinks between input and output occur depending on the particular\r\ntype of AI algorithm or other (semi-) automated decision making\r\nalgorithm. Future reviews are encouraged to look into the black box,\r\nfor a white box (or gray box) approach. Such research should also\r\nconsider how real-life complex attacks are performed, as chains\r\nof attack techniques, and thereby address a potential drawback of\r\nusing the technique-based D3FEND framework. On the level of D3FEND techniques, it is worth noting that all\r\nsolutions that use Platform Monitoring as input produce Network\r\nIsolation as output, and 78% of the solutions using Network Traffic\r\nAnalysis as input produce Network Isolation as output. One inter-\r\npretation of this is that Network Isolation is the primary kind of\r\ndefensive measure to employ. Another interpretation is that many\r\nNetwork Isolation measures require knowledge about the assets in\r\nthe network, events on machines, and analysis of network traffic.

It should be noted that many of the play-\r\nbooks in commercially available products concern the enrichment\r\nof data by connecting alerts to threat intelligence, asset inventories\r\netc. One interpretation of this is that aggregation and normalization\r\nof data, in different formats and in different sources, is a substantial\r\npart of the problem of producing automated responses. It could\r\nbe that researchers have avoided this input management part of\r\nthe problem because they want to produce something generic and\r\ntool independent. It could also be that this part of the problem has\r\nbeen avoided simply because it is complicated and not as academi-\r\ncally rewarding as describing mathematical reasoning on abstract\r\nproperties such as signal strength, threat levels, and response costs. Conversely, there may be things that practitioners could learn from\r\nthe current state of research. For instance, playbook developers\r\ncould focus more on D3FEND techniques that are common in re-\r\nsearch but rare in practice, e.g. Network Mapping and Platform\r\nMonitoring for input, or Credential Hardening and Decoy Environ-\r\nment for output. Playbook developers could also learn from what\r\ninputs and outputs researchers focus on that are not in D3FEND\r\nnor in current playbooks.

The four interpretations relate to either the study identification,\r\ninclusion criteria, extraction or synthesis and comparison to com-\r\nmercial products. First, the search string used to identify scholarly literature was\r\nintentionally narrowed in order to find a manageable number of\r\nrecords. It is the belief of the authors that the chosen search string\r\nand indexing database accurately captured the literature on auto-\r\nmatic solutions for responding to cyber incidents. However, the\r\nrequirement that papers should explicitly mention something re-\r\nlated to automated responses excludes many solutions that focus\r\nmore on the input than on the output.

How-\r\never, the authors of this review did not identify any such papers\r\nin the preliminary searches while constructing the search string,\r\nand were not aware of any such missing papers from previous\r\nexperience. Second, abstracts and full text records were used to sort out pa-\r\npers describing solutions of the type addressed in this review. The\r\ntwo authors rated papers independently, and an inclusive approach\r\nwas taken. This inclusivity is visible in the extracted D3FEND tech-\r\nniques from each of the papers, where seven included papers did\r\nnot contain anything that could be mapped to D3FEND. Despite\r\nthe inclusive approach, it is still possible that some relevant papers\r\nwere excluded in the screening process. In order to minimize dif-\r\nferences between the authors’ decisions and fine-tune the criteria,\r\nthere were several discussions on the particularities of the decision\r\nmaking process, as well as some randomly chosen overlapping de-\r\ncisions, e.g. with both authors rating the same paper followed by\r\ndiscussion of rating differences. However, there was no complete\r\npilot-review, where all stages of the review process were trialed\r\nin order to align judgements further or fine-tune inclusion and\r\nextraction criteria. Third, the extraction process was associated with a number of\r\njudgement calls. As noted above, the papers were not always clear\r\non what they required as input or produced as output, and they\r\noften produced outputs not compatible with D3FEND.

In many cases, the papers describe a generic concept\r\nand offer more or less concrete examples of how this concept can\r\nbe instantiated. For instance, a list of example responses may be\r\nprovided. In those cases, the examples are used as the scope of the\r\nsolution. When no concrete examples were presented, no mapping\r\nwas made to D3FEND techniques. The authors’ ability to understand\r\nthe solutions described in the papers, the use of concrete examples\r\nas the definitive scope of the solution, and the decision to ignore\r\nvague descriptions, are all threats to validity.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"EwSU5pi2Vc54c07m4Oq5y6sf8vBuzs4bDi8gnyXAIOI="},"e439bdb0-de44-461e-b5b2-37bfa446e0cc":{"id_":"e439bdb0-de44-461e-b5b2-37bfa446e0cc","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf_7","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"rqtECjMHArXOdcPqoPwyMVdBFn/122mH4Dtjt21nsPo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7042e2f4-990a-4c3e-b68b-83ec39380e9e","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"EwSU5pi2Vc54c07m4Oq5y6sf8vBuzs4bDi8gnyXAIOI="}},"text":"However, the decision\r\nto focus on the concrete, but ignore vague descriptions, is justified\r\nby the assessment that vagueness will anyway be a poor guide for\r\nidentifying research gaps.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"5kz9bwU8mlC0FWwBs8GjdTRM2y1XVD3r9vstHkEDELQ="},"2cd1087e-e235-4f80-b7ce-c877e8cead4e":{"id_":"2cd1087e-e235-4f80-b7ce-c877e8cead4e","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf_8","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"ewVnQe4XGZhAkdepFDB0URUxE9iXSBFX9Hp3VwA8Feg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1eb70e7e-e264-4fab-a5ed-89484da29c35","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"Vh4lSlJ2Mvh00kiWpXNoFa8AzWzfKg+LAymN0UStDAw="}},"text":"ARES 2023, August 29–September 01, 2023, Benevento, Italy                                                                                                                               Henrik Karlzen and Teodor Sommestad\r\nFourth, the synthesis and comparison to commercial products\r\ncould  have  been  done  in  other  ways. Alternatives  to  D3FEND\r\nwere considered. In retrospect, it is clear that many of the vaguely\r\ndescribed solutions were a poor fit with the abstraction level of\r\nD3FEND. A model with input as defined by [1] (network input,\r\nhost input, or input from a SIEM system) would have suited many\r\nof the academic papers better. On the other hand, a model on the\r\nlevel of abstraction of Splunk’s Common information model is\r\nwhat an operational solution would have to work on and would be\r\nmore informative to a practitioner, and could have been mapped\r\nto the commercial playbooks. D3FEND was chosen because it is a\r\ncompromise between these two extremes. 5  CONCLUSIONS\r\nThis paper identified 45 papers describing a technical solution that\r\nautomatically responds to cyber attacks, and analyzed the papers’\r\ninput and output using the D3FEND framework. The input to these\r\nsolutions were a mix of system information and detection alerts. The system information available in an Asset Inventory (31%) and\r\ndetails about Network Mappings (16%) were commonly used. The\r\nmore common detection inputs were Platform Monitoring (11%)\r\nand Network Traffic Analysis (22%). Among responses, Network\r\nIsolation (67%), Process Eviction (33%), and Platform Hardening\r\n(18%) were the most common. In addition, many solutions proposed\r\nmeasures not covered by D3FEND, e.g. to shut down machines\r\n(24%). Commercially available solutions appear to be more focused\r\non Identifier Analysis (e.g. reputation of domains) and File Analysis\r\n(e.g. scan email attachments). Commercial repositories also contain\r\nmany playbooks enriching data by looking up things in different\r\ndatabases. REFERENCES\r\n[1]Anuar, N.B.et al.2010.

Thus, it is essential that\r\ncyber forensic investigators are supported to operate more efficiently, in terms of resources and evidence\r\nrecovery, and cope with a wide range of cyber incidents. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of 49 works that aim to support cyber forensic in-\r\nvestigations of modern multi-stage cyber incidents and highlights the need for decision support systems\r\non thefield. The works reviewed are compared using 11 criteria, such as their evaluation method, how they\r\noptimise the forensic process, or what stage of investigation they study. We also classify the surveyed\r\npapers using 8 categories that represent the overall aim of the proposed cyber investigation method or\r\ntool. We identify and discuss open issues, arising from this extensive survey, such as the need for realistic\r\nevaluation, as well as realistic and representative modelling to increase applicability and performance. Finally, we provide directions for future research on improving the state-of-the-art of cyber forensics. ©2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These characteristics have made cyber forensic investigations\r\nmore complex, knowledge-demanding and time consuming. In-\r\nvestigators need to spend a significant amount of time to keep their\r\nknowledge and training up-to-date to be able to cope with the\r\nevolution of the current threat landscape. Consequently, the need\r\nhas arisen for decision support methods that will allow in-\r\nvestigators to increase their efficiency (Harichandran et al., 2016)\r\nand complete the analysis of sophisticated cyber incidents,\r\ninvolving a variety of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs),\r\nefficiently and in a timely manner.

We include approaches, both\r\ntechnical and non-technical, that can improve the efficiency of the\r\ninvestigation  of  sophisticated  cyber  security  breaches.

Advanced persistent threats\r\nAlthough originally the term APT was used to refer only to so-\r\nphisticated threat groups that were sponsored by a third-party\r\nentity, currently it has a broader meaning (Ahmad et al., 2019). Specifically, it represents strategic Attackers who are: (i) highly\r\nmotivated and determined to achieve their goals, (ii) stealthy to\r\navoid detection, (iii) deploy a variety of sophisticated TTPs, and (iv)\r\nperform long term or reiterated attack campaigns (Martin, 2014). APT campaigns consist of multiple stages that range from the\r\nreconnaissance and planning of the attack to the achievement of\r\nthe Attackers’final goals. There have been many similar life-cycle\r\nmodels proposed that represent these stages, such as the Unified\r\nKill Chain (Pols and van den Berg, 2017). The termTactics, Tech-\r\nniques, and Procedures(TTPs) is used to describe the behaviour,\r\naims and objectives of such adversaries, as well as the techniques\r\nthey deploy to achieve them (Johnson et al., 2016).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"f6mlqb5yehEupJUmFac/UW/QgYkAxL4zNd3FXQbjtJg="},"f8c4fa15-9476-4e87-9f15-b606613dcb57":{"id_":"f8c4fa15-9476-4e87-9f15-b606613dcb57","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"2tuPAO911PqJRFHSiPd8+mIAro6E4sqwAbBqWZm1bpg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"935ddadf-e15f-437e-bf91-b6d88684ce79","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"f6mlqb5yehEupJUmFac/UW/QgYkAxL4zNd3FXQbjtJg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3034dd1c-1a46-4a38-bf27-bb4171a7ced1","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"YeKSYS0inKzgQbEFpGSl0CFPHK4awq/gZBb1chBWY4Q="}},"text":"Currently, the\r\nmost well-known and used knowledge base of TTPs is the MITRE\r\nATT&CK1 framework, which is constructed using real-world ob-\r\nservations through the collection and processing of past incident\r\nreports. 2.2. Cyber forensics\r\nDigital forensics(DF) is the science of collecting, analysing and\r\nreporting evidence from data found on electronic media (Casey,\r\n2009). It combines computer science and investigative proced-\r\nures to investigate (Vacca, 2012) either: (i) criminal activity that\r\ninvolves but does not directly targets computer systems or any\r\nelectronic device, or (ii) malicious activity that directly targets or\r\ninvolves computer systems and networks. The sub-field of DF that\r\nis focused on the latter, and thus overlaps with thefield of cyber\r\nsecurity, is calledcyber forensics. There are many similar or identical investigative process models\r\nfor cyber forensics, but a typical one consists of the following\r\nstages: collection, examination, correlation, and reporting (Kent\r\net al., 2006). Each one of those stages consists of multiple tech-\r\nnical or non-technical tasks. The collection stage includes the\r\nidentification of the media or data that may be related and useful to\r\nthe case, as well as their labelling, recording, acquisition, and\r\nintegrity preservation according to the relevant guidelines. After\r\nthe collection is complete, during the examination stage, the\r\ninvestigator needs to assess and extract relevant information from\r\nthe collected data in an automated or manual way. This is essen-\r\ntially the technical analysis of the data collected and it may include\r\navarietyof tasks, such as examination of the registry, certain events\r\nfrom the collected logs, process analysis or malware extraction\r\nfrom the collected memory dumps or network analysis. It may also\r\ninclude tasks such as decryption, de-obfuscation, reverse engi-\r\nneering or bypassing of certain security features. The correlation stage is where the uncovered information is\r\nconnected and interpreted in an objective and logical way using\r\ndifferent types of inference and reasoning methods.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Q45n91o+aGc96Vl+/Sl7PyJs3DGr8OcN4x+y6a+aoNQ="},"3034dd1c-1a46-4a38-bf27-bb4171a7ced1":{"id_":"3034dd1c-1a46-4a38-bf27-bb4171a7ced1","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"2tuPAO911PqJRFHSiPd8+mIAro6E4sqwAbBqWZm1bpg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f8c4fa15-9476-4e87-9f15-b606613dcb57","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"Q45n91o+aGc96Vl+/Sl7PyJs3DGr8OcN4x+y6a+aoNQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d425231c-810f-45cf-9809-cbf3ad80ae23","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"ENt3VncsCzccTsyKK08nuADer0qfFdgDL59+OFj816I="}},"text":"This may\r\ninclude guidelines and frameworks for good practices or/and tools\r\nand reasoner systems that deploy methods, such as case-based\r\nreasoning (CBR) (Kolodner, 2014), temporal aggregation (Gresty\r\net al., 2016) and forward and backward reasoning (Sharma et al.,\r\n2012).

Instead, we focus on the decision support methods that are aware\r\nof the potential existence of anti-forensic techniques as part of the\r\nincident under investigation.

While\r\nthe authors focus on the high-level investigation process, we focus\r\non the part of the technical analysis and its efficiency. Quick and Choo (2014)study how the large amount of produced\r\ndata affects modern forensic investigations.

Contrary, in this survey\r\nwe review the literature for works that aim to support cyber\r\nforensic investigations, i.e., the investigation of modern multi-stage\r\nincidents potentially performed by strategic Attackers (e.g., APTs),\r\nby increasing their efficiency. This could be achieved either on a\r\ntechnical or more abstract level, in a automated or manual way, by\r\nproposing tools, reasoning frameworks or decision support\r\nsystems. 3. Methodology\r\n3.1. Inclusion criteria\r\nOur aim in this survey is to review works that can be used\r\nduring cyber forensic investigations of modern sophisticated multi-\r\nstage attacks to increase the efficiency and quality of the investi-\r\ngative process. We note that the relevant literature is somewhat\r\nlimited, therefore we included the most known or promising works\r\nin our list that directly or indirectly support any part of such an\r\ninvestigation. Thus the inclusion criteria for this work can be summarised as:\r\nCWorks that directly support and aim to make more efficient\r\nthe technical or non technical phases of a forensic investi-\r\ngation in an automated or manual way. CWorks that although may have not been proposed as cyber\r\ninvestigation support methods, they can be used for this\r\npurpose. An example of this would be a work that has been\r\nproposed as a defence mechanism for event correlation, but\r\nit can obviously be applied to an investigation as well. CWorks that directly or indirectly support the investigation of\r\nmulti-stage attacks. Directly refers to the case where a paper\r\ntakes the multi-stage nature of an incident in consideration\r\nin its modelling and methodology. On the opposite hand,\r\nindirectly refers to a work that although it is not created for a\r\nmulti-stage incident, it can be applied to one.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"62kEJHVWTdj0Kj6/E5isaUV27sUYqXQu0JLX7IeBC88="},"26f43581-81f7-4085-a1d4-78eb7b430a95":{"id_":"26f43581-81f7-4085-a1d4-78eb7b430a95","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf_3","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"AxgCslMf0+fzqWKJWefTR7C+2RAp69CpnEs9jKqqV3E="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"55ebad83-08d7-483b-bc69-12fe9da15dc6","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"62kEJHVWTdj0Kj6/E5isaUV27sUYqXQu0JLX7IeBC88="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7505eaae-1739-4000-8f0d-8fd2bc52f84b","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"Qul1X5nN6y1aiN4ErR7u6xpMhjTG48bHHFukkrqQLhw="}},"text":"With regards to our paper inclusion methodology, we initially\r\ncreated afirst pool of papers based on searches on digital libraries,\r\nsuch as Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital Library with\r\nkeywords like“digital forensics optimisation”,“cyber forensics”,\r\n“forensic decision support”,“multi-stage attack forensic analysis”,\r\netc. We also enumerated the proceedings of relevant top confer-\r\nences and journals like ACM Symposium on Computer and Com-\r\nmunications Security, Digital Forensic Research Workshop, IEEE\r\nTransactions on Information Forensics and Security, and Forensic\r\nScience International: Digital Investigation.

They use a set of\r\nrootkits and anti-rootkits for Windows XP to extract characteristics\r\nfor each software used to derive the benefit and cost values of each\r\nplayer's payoff function. The authors use the Nash Equilibrium (NE)\r\nof the game to identify future improvements that could enhance\r\nthe performance of anti-rootkits. The main difference between the two works is the performance\r\nimprovement achieved in (Hasanabadi et al., 2021). To overcome\r\nthe re-simulation problem caused by the constant need of\r\nexpansion of the action space, the authors propose the use of a\r\nmemory-based mechanism. The mechanism takes as input the\r\noriginal strategy space as well as a list of strategies to be added. After solving the NE of the original game, it iterates through the list,\r\nadding one strategy at a time,finding the corresponding NE and\r\nobserving the opponent's empirical frequencies.

Contrary to most of the literature, the Attacker is\r\nnot simulated as a player, but instead the game is rather a coop-\r\neration between two investigators, who are working in the same\r\ncase and can each select one tool to use during the investigation.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qMU5ooH6ziYcynhArmxm8Cv1kt8DShzomSwPL/068WY="},"2cf5b93b-ce49-4cad-99bb-e7b7e157a175":{"id_":"2cf5b93b-ce49-4cad-99bb-e7b7e157a175","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf_5","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"XnHIAeJYMrhSa/6xMyVodGyN3qCk3VY7RqSHTpZpQjI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"960cb3a1-c1cf-418d-809d-02e305baa516","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"qMU5ooH6ziYcynhArmxm8Cv1kt8DShzomSwPL/068WY="}},"text":"As summarised inTable 1, none of three works for tool selection\r\ntake in consideration the multistage nature of modern incidents or\r\nutilise a knowledge base.

Workload Optimisation\r\nYan et al. (2019)model the database auditing problem as a\r\nStackelberg zero-sum game between an auditor and an adversary. The authors assume different type of events that need to be audited\r\nusing a limited budget, i.e., time, while considering the potential\r\npolicy validations by strategic adversaries. The proposed method\r\nwas shown to outperform traditional auditing policies. De Braekt\r\net al. (de Braekt et al., 2016) propose a workflow management\r\nautomation framework that aims to optimise the use of limited\r\nresources of hardware and software during the acquisition and\r\npreparation steps of forensic investigations. The authors propose\r\nthree modules, each one of which consists of a workflow, which\r\nallows the automation of certain tasks during those steps so that\r\nmore time can be spent on the analysis of evidence. The study of the literature suggests (seeTable 2) that the\r\nnumber of works that optimise the resources of investigations is\r\nlimited. This does not align with the current industry needs, where\r\ncompanies are constantly trying to utilise their resources efficiently\r\nto meet service level agreements (SLAs) and decrease the respond\r\ntime. Neither works utilise a knowledge base, which could decrease\r\nthe active time required byt the investigator. Fortunately, both\r\nworks present a complete evaluation using real data. The work in\r\n(Yan et al., 2019) uses real medical access logs and the Statlog\r\n(German Credit Data) dataset, while (de Braekt et al., 2016)is\r\nevaluated against a real human trafficking case. However, in the\r\nformer the cost and benefit parameters were assumed, i.e., not\r\ngenerated or calculated based on real data. Thus, it is not clear how\r\nthe variation of those parameters would affect the performance of\r\nthe proposed policy. 4.3.

Anti-forensics detection\r\nStamm et al.

Byfinding the NA of the pro-\r\nposed game, the authors identify the optimal trade-off strategy for\r\neach player. The adversary aims to balance the trade-off between\r\nthe use of anti-forensic techniques to hide evidence and the evi-\r\ndence generated by these techniques, while the investigator needs\r\nto balance the accuracy with which she detects manipulated\r\nmultimedia and the accuracy of detecting the use of anti-forensics. Both works use a combination of real and generated data (Table 3). 4.4. Efficiency and Decision Support\r\nHorsman et al. (2014)presents CBR-FT, a case reasoning-based\r\nmethod that aims to increase the efficiency of device triage. CBR-\r\nFT produces a list offile system paths with high probability of\r\ncontaining evidence. To do so it calculates a similarity rating of each\r\npath based on a knowledge base of past cases and input variables. Liu et al. in (Liu et al., 2012a) propose the incorporation of attack\r\ngraphs in forensic investigations to guide the decision process of\r\nthe investigator. The authors also introduce to the graph the notion\r\nof anti-forensic steps, which may be taken by the adversary to hide\r\nmalicious evidence, as parallel actions to the main nodes. Later in (Liu et al., 2012b) and (Liu et al., 2013), the authors\r\npresented a more optimised use of attack graphs in investigations,\r\nby proposing an algorithm that maps evidence graphs on attack\r\ngraphs to identify missing evidence that the investigator needs to\r\nsearch for. In this way, a graph is not simply used as a manual guide\r\nfor the investigator, but part of the reasoning process is automated\r\nto offer suggestions, which results in more efficient investigation. Barrere et al. in (Barr\u0001ere et al., 2017) introduced core graphs,\r\nwhich are condensed versions of attack graphs.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"K6wrlp15WhRRNI52spaJtUencQbfHXUxSUAydEGe3pc="},"b162d914-88ce-4542-9d48-c8307290238e":{"id_":"b162d914-88ce-4542-9d48-c8307290238e","metadata":{"page_number":6,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf_6","metadata":{"page_number":6,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"bOxAfChd9xEST29i4mY9zhSh7226Mti5cLeXLYsQlYw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d866db73-578f-4bdc-8826-760c9805a67a","metadata":{"page_number":6,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"K6wrlp15WhRRNI52spaJtUencQbfHXUxSUAydEGe3pc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c2f03cd7-830d-41b0-a247-eefe163d69ca","metadata":{"page_number":6,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"9QETSft9RZPlnSu0BS2WkB5GveSQBWDtqf/LuDXMOMQ="}},"text":"The authors pro-\r\npose an algorithm that transforms the structure of the original\r\nattack graph to allow for a more efficient exploration.

Niu et al. (2017)model an APT attack as a Targeted Complex\r\nAttack Network (TCAN) by combining dynamic attack graphs and\r\nnetwork evolution. Specifically, the targeted network is modelled\r\nas a two-layered stochastic graph, where thefirst layer represents\r\nthe human social interaction and the second layer the network\r\ntopology. Nodes correspond to hosts, while edges represent the\r\nrelationship between nodes. Finally, network theory is utilised to\r\ncreate rules that capture the time domain factor of the attacker. Arshad et al. (2020)propose FIMOSN, a model to semi-automate\r\nthe forensic investigation of online social networks (OSN). FIMOSN\r\nis a formally defined process model that can be applied to the\r\ndifferentstages of the investigation.It consists of twotypesof steps,\r\nautomated, e.g. the formulation of the Information Extraction Zone,\r\nand manual, e.g. Data Examination. Contrary to other similar\r\nmodels FIMOSN includes the ability of hypothesis testing, as well as\r\nthe ability to adapt to the size of the incident and its requirements. Wei  et  al. (2021)propose  an  unsupervised  prediction\r\nframework for proactive forensic investigation of insider threats. The framework combines cascaded autoencoders (CAEs) and joint\r\noptimisation (CPJOS) for the detection of the anomalous activities\r\nthrough user behaviour features extracted via natural language\r\nprocessing.

Attack reconstruction\r\nMilajerdi et al. (2019)propose HOLMES, a system that uses TTPs\r\nfrom MITRE ATT&CK and the typical APT life-cycle to correlate\r\naudit logs. Specifically, it uses tag propagation and predefined\r\npolicies for backward and forward analysis to correlate audit logs to\r\nTTPs and then organise the TTPs in APTstages. In this way, HOLMES\r\ngenerated high-level graphs for the investigator and is able to\r\nreconstruct APTcampaigns in a timely manner with high precision. Hossain et al. present SLEUTH (Hossain et al., 2017), an OS\r\nagnostic system for real-time attack reconstruction from COTS\r\naudit logs. The proposed system constructs a memory efficient\r\ndependence event graph and uses policy-based approach to\r\ncorrelate events that belong to the same attack. The alerts are then\r\npassed to a backward analysis algorithm to identify source of the\r\nattack. During the evaluation SLEUTH reconstructed 70% of the\r\nattacks in real time. Later in (Hossain et al., 2018) the authors propose two methods,\r\nnamely full dependence preservation (FD) and source dependence\r\npreservation (SD), that allow the reduction of the size of depen-\r\ndence graphs, while preserving the accuracy of the results of the\r\nforensic analysis. Specifically, they prove that the proposed\r\nmethods preserve forward and backward reachability and do not\r\naffect the results of backward and forward forensic analysis. The\r\nevaluation showed that FD and SD can achieve an average of 7x and\r\n9.2x reduction correspondingly, while the LCD reduction algorithm\r\nproposed in (Xu et al., 2016) achieved only a 1.8x.

(2020)proposed MORSE, a system that\r\nuses the tag attenuation and tag decay propagation techniques, to\r\nhelp the analyst reconstruct attacks from large amounts of data. Similarly to their previous works, MORSE uses dependence graphs\r\nto identify events of the same attack. Contrary to SLEUTH, MORSE\r\napplies a conservative tag propagation policy to suspicious subjects\r\nand a more lenient to benign subjects, which allows it to produce a\r\nsmaller number of false positives in real time. Ghafir et al. (2018)propose MLAPT, a machine learning based\r\nsystem for reconstruction of multi-stage APT attacks. MLAPT con-\r\nsists of three phases: (i) threat detection, (ii) alert correlation and\r\n(ii) prediction. At thefirst stage a combination of rules and black-\r\nlists are used to detect TTPs used by APTs from network traffic. The\r\nalerts from stage are fed to the second stage for correlation of the\r\ncampaigns based on the APT lifecycle model. In thefinal stage, a\r\nclassifier based prediction module calculates the probabilistic sig-\r\nnificance of each alert with the aim of minimising their potential\r\ndamage. Although MLAPTdoes notoutperformall the past works, it\r\nis able tooffer a true positiverate of 82%, while minimising the false\r\npositive rate to 5.4% and providing decision support to the analysts\r\nthrough its prediction module. Marchetti et al. (2016)propose a framework for the recon-\r\nstruction of the data exfiltration APT stage from large volumes of\r\nnetworkflows. Contrary to previous works, the authors do not only\r\nuse network wide statistics to identify malicious hosts, but focus on\r\nindividual hosts by comparing their behaviour both to past data\r\nand other hosts in the network. To this end, they calculate a score\r\nfrom a set of three features consisting of three suspiciousness sub-\r\nscores. The proposed framework is evaluated using data from a real\r\nnetwork containing 10K hosts injected with realistic exfiltration\r\nattacks and is shown to be able to detect burst and low-and-slow\r\nexfiltration attempts.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ft3AgNYA3JZR17Qfj99QbvmdHlVpT6Ox0Lc728DfmXM="},"e5b76fd6-f126-4e09-8548-c834d4059e10":{"id_":"e5b76fd6-f126-4e09-8548-c834d4059e10","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf_8","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"SItJTGPM+ULqAxLownJEWoKRNXWeOpNuY5x5R7+L2Ck="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"64f5acaa-5863-46ef-bd2c-629e599f7185","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"ft3AgNYA3JZR17Qfj99QbvmdHlVpT6Ox0Lc728DfmXM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9266eab5-e045-4761-ae58-fd6f0d689f2c","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"1RLfNADh+LzqKPuqvZES4yXhyOYg1CTuCnPY4WsPaT8="}},"text":"Wang and Daniels (2005a),(Wang and Daniels, 2005b) presenta\r\nhierarchical reasoning framework for network forensics that cor-\r\nrelates hosts that belong to the same attack using evidence graphs\r\nof IDS alerts.

Finally,Horsman (2021)presents the Device Evaluation and\r\nPrioritisation Scoresheet (DEPS). DEPS is a structure that assist re-\r\nsponders to identify and collect the digital devices on the scene but\r\nalso to assume and record their priority and importance on the\r\ncurrent case. In this way DEPS does not only support the responder\r\nbut also allows the investigator who receives the collected devices\r\nto optimise the workflow based on the provided formal decision\r\nrecord. Similarly,Beebe and Clark (2005)propose a multi-tier hierar-\r\nchical framework for reasoning guidance during forensic in-\r\nvestigations. The framework consists of two tiers. Thefirst tier is a\r\nhigh level abstraction of a six phase investigation process that in-\r\ncludes the following phases: preparation, incident response, data\r\ncollection, data analysis, presentation offindings and incident\r\nclosure. The second tier includes objective based sub-phases for\r\neach phase of tier one. In this way, the proposed framework can be\r\nused as a guide for both high level and technical parts of the\r\ninvestigation, while being technologically neutral and easily\r\nextensible by the user community. Rekhis and Boudriga (2011a)formally model the investigation\r\nprocess and propose the use of an inference system to detect the\r\npresence of anti-forensics. Specifically, the authors model the sys-\r\ntem under investigation, its deployed security controls, potential\r\nattacks and the corresponding evidence using state-based logic. The authors present a small case study to demonstrate the use of\r\nthe proposed system. The authors also propose investigation-based\r\nTemporal Logic of Actions (I-TLA), a formal temporal logic for\r\ntesting of potential multi-stage attack scenarios on a system\r\n(Rekhis and Boudriga, 2011b). I-TLA is a high-level specification\r\nlanguage that allows an investigator to model different sources of\r\nevidence related to a case, define attack scenarios and hypothesis\r\ntest them on the evidence. Turnbull et al. (Turnbull and Randhawa, 2015) combine a multi-\r\nontology representation of low level data and SPARQLer, a forward\r\nchain rule-based reasoning system to allow investigators to derive\r\nhigh level abstractions and triage the data more efficiently.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"P/AQtdiVcLu32V9k4Mjnum8VAqE79MDIcPF/gmhW9us="},"70459c62-5a65-425e-b75b-7ce3ad37006a":{"id_":"70459c62-5a65-425e-b75b-7ce3ad37006a","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf_10","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"nW7xJzcbz45vdGu57LhjRjTk1i2eeCn/pnpOWehouxY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2b654ee5-03f2-4bac-a5da-9c7f1d2aaf1f","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"P/AQtdiVcLu32V9k4Mjnum8VAqE79MDIcPF/gmhW9us="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5e85b31a-1ea7-4d18-a3d1-ae135aa8b566","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"VJEqfNyLaQBJKxpzzfzMZkw9ZzBaNg2c+jpNhByliEc="}},"text":"First,\r\nthe authors use multiple ontologies to represent system and user\r\nevents from different sources. Then SPARQLer is used to correlate\r\nthe events using predefined rules and forward chain logic. Soltani and Seno (2019)propose the use of temporal logic to\r\nallow the investigator to perform hypothesis testing for event\r\nreconstruction purposes. First, the system under investigation is\r\nmodelled as a transition system both on its normal state (before the\r\nincident) and its current state. Then, the investigator is able to\r\nexpress the properties and hypothesis she wishes to evaluate using\r\nmodalm-calculus. Finally, a checking algorithm explores the state of\r\nthe model and checks if the defined properties are present. Furthermore, the authors address the state space explosion prob-\r\nlem, which is a common drawback on such systems. The proposed\r\nframework is demonstrated using a FATfile system. Saad and Traore (2010)present a framework for network fo-\r\nrensics that consists of a method ontology and a reasoning module. The ontology has different classes to represent the network fo-\r\nrensics domain objects and subjects, as well as their relations and it\r\nsupports deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning operations. Unfortunately, as with other ontology-based works, the construc-\r\ntion and maintenance tasks require a lot of time and effort and\r\ncould benefit from automation.Nieto (2020)presented JSON Users\r\nand Devices analysis (JUDAS), as system for the extraction and\r\ncorrelation of heterogeneous forensic data from IoT devices. JUDAS\r\nextracts unique objects, such as users or devices, from casefiles and\r\ncorrelates them with additional internal sources, e.g., network\r\ntraffic, and external sources, i.e., OSINT. The results are then pre-\r\nsented using interactive graphs to the analyst. The proposed tool is\r\nvalidated using data from Amazon's Alexa from the DFRW 2017/18\r\nchallenge. Amato et al. (2019)present an extensible framework that uti-\r\nlises text processing techniques that allows the investigator to\r\nsemantically represent and visualise evidence from different\r\nsources of the same case. Specifically, the authors propose an ar-\r\nchitecture that receives as input any type of multimedia and text\r\nbased evidence and allows the investigator to perform reasoning\r\nbased on predefined rules, as well as query the data and visualise\r\nthem.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"0JaWAhFL3yVdRILigSXVE/4v/IepPw4ytMI4JXICym0="},"5e85b31a-1ea7-4d18-a3d1-ae135aa8b566":{"id_":"5e85b31a-1ea7-4d18-a3d1-ae135aa8b566","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf_10","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"nW7xJzcbz45vdGu57LhjRjTk1i2eeCn/pnpOWehouxY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"70459c62-5a65-425e-b75b-7ce3ad37006a","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"0JaWAhFL3yVdRILigSXVE/4v/IepPw4ytMI4JXICym0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d1f9df3b-f172-4fd3-afb8-afedc12e93c1","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"EpEahlyfe+LuvvZR+mVMDEFxE4Qw9AsBibFAwUkG8w0="}},"text":"In this way, the proposed framework increases the efficiency\r\nof the correlation of evidence and enhances the investigator's\r\nreasoning capabilities.

The proposed framework is demonstrated\r\nusing the HAFNIUM exchange attack. The comparison of the aforementioned works is summarised in\r\nTable 6.

Han et al. (2019)propose a data-driven, case-based reasoning\r\nframework for decision support on attribution of website deface-\r\nment cases. The proposed framework allows investigators to\r\ncompare their defacement case with past cases and identify the\r\nmost similarones.

Specifically, the Attacker is allowed to move in continuous time\r\nusing a probabilistic distribution, while the defender is moving in\r\nfixed intervals that represent working hours.

Open Issue 1:As can be observed inFig. 3a more than 54%\r\n(Demonstration, No Evaluation and Generated Data) of the sur-\r\nveyed papers did not provide an adequate evaluation of the pro-\r\nposed method. Namely an assessment of the effectiveness of the\r\nproposed method, not a simple demonstration of its use, using real\r\nor realistic data and potentially its comparison against a baseline or\r\npast work to allow better understanding of the results. Specifically,\r\n34% simply demonstrated the proposed method, i.e., showcased\r\nhow it can be applied but did not evaluate its effectiveness or\r\nperformance in any way, while 10% provided no evaluation at all. Moreover, 10% used generated data for the evaluation, i.e., unreal-\r\nistic data that are randomlygenerated and not representative of the\r\nproblem. These facts prohibit the rest of the community from\r\ndrawing robust conclusions regarding the significance and contri-\r\nbution of those works. The reliability and evaluation of a work is essential in anyfield\r\nbut is especially critical in forensics given that the outcome of an\r\ninvestigation is presented either to: (i) the decision makers of the\r\ntargeted organisation, or (ii) a court of law, where the investigator\r\nneeds to be able to support theirfindings (Williams, 2012). One of\r\nthe reasons for this lack of evaluation could be the sensitivity of the\r\ndata related to cyber investigations, which may have been part of\r\nongoing criminal investigations, or cannot be shared for privacy\r\nreasons related to individuals involved in the case or organisations\r\nand companies. In many cases, sharing data from incidents can\r\nreveal private information regarding the infrastructure of an\r\norganisation, technologies in use and current defence mechanisms. This can also be observed fromTable 10, where most of the\r\nutilised datasets are not publicly available, which prohibits the\r\ncomparison between the experimental results of the reviewed\r\nworks.

Another unrealistic\r\nassumption is the use of zero-sumgames (46%,Fig. 6)as theydonot\r\nalign with the motivations of players. The assumption that the\r\npayoffs of the players sum to zero, i.e., one player's gain is equiv-\r\nalent to the other player's loss, goes against the most simplistic\r\nmodel of an interaction between a Defenderand an Attacker, where\r\nonly one of the players may collect the benefit but they both suffer\r\ncosts for their actions. Open Issue 3:Only 2 works use TTPs for the modelling (Fig. 7),\r\nwhile 6 use vulnerabilities, which limits the applicability of the\r\nproposed work on a wide range of incidents, as not all of the At-\r\ntacker's actions can be represented as vulnerabilities. This is\r\nbecause many actions do not include the exploitation of a vulner-\r\nability, but also because a vulnerability is not able to capture any\r\nbehavioural or contextual information regarding the Attacker. Adversarial TTPs are more abstract than vulnerabilities or specific\r\nevents and thus they are able to describe the adversarial behaviour,\r\nits motive and execution instead of simplya technicalflaw that may\r\nbe exploited. In this way, TTPs are applicable in a wider range of\r\ninvestigations and do not face the zero-day shortcoming that vul-\r\nnerabilities do.

As the use of anti-forensic or evasion techniques is on\r\nthe rise (Mandiant, 2021), frameworks and systems that support\r\nthe investigation of modern cyber incidents should be aware of\r\nsuch techniques and incorporate their existence to their modelling\r\nand development process. This is because anti-forensic techniques\r\nallow Attackers to conceal, delete or replace part of their traces. Thus, ignoring their existence may lead to wrong conclusions and\r\ninterpretation of the evidence. This could be avoided by including\r\non the proposed models or frameworks an element of uncertainty\r\nor trust level on the side of the Defender regarding the actions of\r\nthe Attacker. Open Issue 6:None of the survey works is implemented in a\r\nway that allows the feedback from the Investigator to be ingested\r\nand utilised for the readjustment of the output. The step-wise\r\ninteraction between the proposed framework or method and the\r\nInvestigator during the analysis, i.e., the production of suggestions\r\nby the framework to the Investigator and the submission of feed-\r\nback by the Investigator to the framework, could allow the cus-\r\ntomisation of the produced output to increase its accuracy. Open Issue 7:Finally, only one of the reviewed works included\r\nthe element of time in their modelling, by using a differential Nash\r\ngame (Yang et al., 2018). However, time is an important factor for\r\nany investigation that can affect the rest of the variables, such as\r\nbenefit and impact, of the investigation. For instance, the longer\r\ncertain adversarial actions (e.g., active exfiltration channel) stay\r\nundisclosed the greater their impact on the infrastructure. Simi-\r\nlarly, many types of evidence, such as IPs, are time sensitive and are\r\nno longer useful after a certain amount of time. Thus, the notion of\r\ntime should be taken in consideration and potential methods that\r\nallow the definition of states and their transition, evolution or\r\ndiscount factors, which have been used in other securityfields,\r\ncould be applied in cyber forensics. 6.

Keywords    Cybersecurity, Regulatory Compliance, Incident Reporting. Abstract      In today’s digital landscape, cyber incidents have become more frequent and sophisticated, posing significant \r\nthreats  to  organizations  and  individuals. To  mitigate  these  risks,  governments  and  regulatory  bodies \r\nworldwide have developed various incident reporting regulations for organizations to follow. However, the \r\neffectiveness of these regulations in handling cyber incidents remains a point of debate. This paper focused \r\non examining current cyber incident reporting regulations and their characteristics, with the primary objective \r\nof identifying the regulatory factors that impact the effectiveness of these regulations. Key aspects under \r\ninvestigation included timing requirements, the clarity in defining cyber incidents, and the provision of \r\nexplicit guidelines regarding the necessity and scope of reporting incidents. Finally, it provides insights into \r\nhow regulatory requirements can be improved to better handle cyber incidents in today’s rapidly evolving \r\nregulatory environment. 1  INTRODUCTION \r\nThe increased reliance on digital technologies and the \r\nrise of ransomware attacks made the start of the 2020s \r\na particularly vulnerable period for cybersecurity. For \r\nexample,  in  March  2021,  the  Health  Service \r\nExecutive  (HSE)  of  Ireland  was  attacked  using a \r\nparticular type of ransomware called “Conti,” which \r\ncaused prolonged interruption of care provision in the \r\nnation’s  healthcare  system  and  severely  affected \r\ncritical services, such as gynecology and maternity \r\nclinics  as  well  as  cancer  and  children’s  care \r\n(Ivanković et al., 2023). Other attacks, including the \r\nJBS Foods ransomware attack, the Kaseya supply-\r\nchain  attack,  and  the  Accellion  data  breach, \r\nhighlighted the persistent and evolving nature of these \r\nthreats  and  demonstrated  the  need  to  adequately \r\nregulate  reporting  mechanisms  (Bunge,  2021; \r\nMerken,  2022;  Whitney,  2021).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"CcCqQComEKrzk45tO/yKftMgn1NgJIkQiteSu/wa40I="},"b30a3554-7f9c-4141-94ec-0738d665589b":{"id_":"b30a3554-7f9c-4141-94ec-0738d665589b","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"hash":"E7izqVH/yAtvZ03gUim9fAwBLjB6NXAZzk36G3JTEss="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0dc039b5-2cc1-4c25-ad1e-198aaa995f78","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"hash":"CcCqQComEKrzk45tO/yKftMgn1NgJIkQiteSu/wa40I="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c5a4dde6-712e-4034-aeb0-ea905342a48a","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"hash":"5Wc9YRoUU+R8bXgpzWvwDWzKgBRUahq8vX4lKZD3+n0="}},"text":"In  the  past,  most \r\nreporting  requirements  were  based  primarily  on \r\nprivacy  issues,  in  particular,  the  disclosure  of \r\nPersonal Identifiable Information (PII).

Over \r\nthe years, significant developments have been made \r\nin developing cyber incident reporting regulations, \r\nincluding  establishing  cybersecurity  agencies  and \r\ncreating cyber threat intelligence sharing platforms. For  instance,  in  the  United  States,  the  National \r\nInstitute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  has \r\ndeveloped   a   comprehensive   framework   for \r\nimproving critical infrastructure cybersecurity (Ross \r\net  al.,  2021). The  framework  provides  a  set  of \r\nstandards,  guidelines,  and  best  practices  to  help \r\norganizations better manage and reduce cyber risks. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security \r\n(DHS)  has  established  the  Cybersecurity  and \r\nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which serves \r\nas  the  nation’s  lead  agency  for  cybersecurity \r\n(Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, \r\nn.d.). CISA helps to coordinate the response to cyber \r\nincidents and provides guidance to organizations on \r\nhow  to  improve  their  cybersecurity  posture. Thus, \r\nagencies such as NIST and CISA play a critical role \r\nin developing and supporting regulatory efforts.

To further clarify the Order, the \r\nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a \r\nmemorandum  in  September  2022  specifying  that \r\nagencies must adhere to the NIST Guidance (Boyens \r\net  al.,  2013;  Young,  2022). This  guidance \r\nrecommends  that  organizations  have  an  incident \r\nresponse plan in place and ensure that employees are \r\nadequately trained to respond to cybersecurity threats. Another  regulation  aimed  at  improving  the \r\nnation’s  cybersecurity  posture  by  strengthening \r\nincident  reporting  and  response  capabilities  is  the \r\nCyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure \r\nAct (CIRCIA), which was signed into law in March \r\n2022. CIRCIA  requires  critical  infrastructure \r\norganizations to report any cyber incidents to CISA \r\nwithin  a  specified  timeframe.

In  particular,  most  experts  agree  that  many  cyber \r\nincidents  involve  a  country’s  Critical  National \r\nInfrastructure (CNI) (Gkioulos & Chowdhury, 2021; \r\nMaglaras  et  al.,  2019). For  example,  the  North \r\nAmerican Electric Reliability Corporation’s Critical \r\nInfrastructure Protection (NERC CIP) was one of the \r\nfirst  incident  reporting  regulations  specifically \r\ndesigned  to  ensure  the  security  of  critical \r\ninfrastructure  systems  and  protect  sensitive  data \r\n(Awati, 2022). Consequently, critical infrastructure \r\nprotection has emerged in the literature as a pressing \r\nconcern and a critical area to examine as part of the \r\nnew  regulatory  landscape  surrounding  incident \r\nreporting (Slayton & Clark-Ginsberg, 2018). However,  some  scholars  argued  that  these \r\nregulations  present  several  challenges  (Madnick, \r\n2022a; Silverajan & Vistiaho, 2019). For instance, \r\none problem is that most countries’ cybersecurity-\r\nrelated  laws  have  focused  on  privacy  rather  than \r\ncybersecurity,  leaving  companies  without  the \r\nnecessary tools and information to report incidents \r\nand  counter  cyber  threats  (Madnick,  2022b).

On the other hand, Andreasson and \r\nFallen (2018) presented a different perspective on this \r\ntopic,  highlighting  the  importance  of  balancing \r\nsecurity objectives with other regulatory goals, such \r\nas privacy, to achieve cyber resiliency.

Cyber  incidents  such  as  those  described  above \r\nhave   provided   important   lessons   about   the \r\nsignificance of incident reporting in regulations. The \r\nfirst  lesson  learned  is  the  importance  of timing  in \r\nreporting.

In  particular,  the  SEC’s \r\nrequirement to report within four business days only \r\napplies  if  the  attack  is  deemed  “material. ” \r\nDetermining whether an incident is “material” can be \r\ncomplex and time-consuming. Therefore, analyzing a \r\ncyber-attack  can  take  weeks,  and  establishing \r\nmateriality can be subjective. As a result, an incident \r\nthat one company views as not material and, thus, is \r\nnot  reported,  would  not  provide  the  useful \r\ninformation  needed  to  prevent  a  similar  attack  on \r\nanother  company  who  would  view  it  as  very \r\n“material. ” \r\n4.2  Definition of an Incident from a \r\nSecurity and Compliance Point of \r\nView \r\nThe  digital  landscape  has  changed  considerably, \r\nmaking  regulations  often unsuitable for  defining a \r\ncyber incident adequately. As a result, organizations \r\nface  the  challenge  of  determining  which  incidents \r\nqualify  as  cyber  incidents  and  which  do  not. To \r\naddress  this  issue,  new  or  updated  legislation  was \r\ncreated to provide clearer definitions. For example, in \r\n2020, the European Commission made a proposal to \r\nupdate the NIS Directive as part of the new EU \r\nCybersecurity  Strategy. As  a  result,  the  revised \r\nDirective (NISD2) provided a much more nuanced \r\ndefinition of a cyber incident than the one outlined in \r\nthe  previous  version issued  in  2016  (NISD) \r\n(Directive (EU) 2016/1148, 2022). However,  interpreting  the  regulations  remains \r\nchallenging, especially in determining if a cyber issue \r\nhas the potential to become an incident. For example, \r\naccording to one official definition provided by NIST, \r\na  cyber  incident  only  requires  an  action  that \r\n“imminently  jeopardizes”  a  system  or  presents  an \r\n“imminent threat” of violating a law (NIST, 2011).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"00o/KAxjjVmT5NJ2F3e626FwCUm3oM5Vnuq6rsQ+PLE="},"8febd7b8-a1cd-4c93-b01b-44dbcb593a89":{"id_":"8febd7b8-a1cd-4c93-b01b-44dbcb593a89","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf_5","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"hash":"bMBww4PEiGir6a6f779KJXCn50XhzLAC0WSkZ93eK2o="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"026faae5-545d-49a6-8813-86e66a1c5cf5","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"hash":"00o/KAxjjVmT5NJ2F3e626FwCUm3oM5Vnuq6rsQ+PLE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"669f2007-3e20-45e9-9f08-f01fab3792b8","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"hash":"3WkG0XJGTndOp1uDIbky8LDfV5+7XNoSah4xYNkk90k="}},"text":"More specifically, a cyber incident is defined as an \r\noccurrence that: \r\n(1)  actually,  or  imminently  jeopardizes,  without \r\nlawful authority, the integrity, confidentiality, \r\nor availability of information or an information \r\nsystem; or  \r\n(2)  constitutes  a  violation  or  imminent  threat  of \r\nviolation  of  law,  security  policies,  security \r\nprocedures, or acceptable use policies. This  definition  includes  incidents  that  do  not \r\nnecessarily need to result in an actual security breach \r\nbut could lead to one (Madnick, 2022a). An analogy \r\nto understand this issue is the aviation term “near \r\nmiss” or “close call,” which refers to the loss of safe \r\nseparation between aircraft in flight (Thoroman et al., \r\n2019). This particular circumstance can result in a \r\nmid-air collision in the worst-case scenario. A similar \r\nsituation  can  occur  in  cybersecurity  as  well.

However,  the  impact  of \r\nthese   regulations   requires   significant   changes \r\nthroughout the organization, which are not just limited \r\nto  the  actions  undertaken  by  security  leaders,  such \r\nas CISOs and CIOs. Top management and the Board \r\nmust be fully aware of the scope of these regulations \r\nand  review  the  related  compliance  procedures \r\naccordingly. Additionally, employees must be trained \r\nto  understand  current  policies  and  processes. Particularly  attention  must  also  be  devoted  to \r\nunderstanding  new  concepts  introduced  in  new \r\nregulations, such those concerning “materiality. ” The \r\ndefinition  of  materiality  may  play  a  critical  role  in \r\ndetermining which incidents should be reported; it can \r\nhelp  organizations  determine  the  significance  or \r\nimpact  an  incident  could have  on  their  operations, \r\nreputation,  or  financial  stability. However,  current \r\nregulations  incorporating  this  concept  may  include \r\nvague requirements and guidance. Thus, organizations \r\nstruggle  to  determine  which  incidents  should  be \r\nreported, leading to issues, such as underreporting or \r\noverreporting  of  incidents. As  a  consequence, \r\nunderreporting incidents can result in regulators being \r\nunaware  of  potential  threats,  while  overreporting \r\nincidents  can  lead  to  a  waste  of  resources. It  is, \r\ntherefore, essential for regulators to enhance current \r\nregulatory  initiatives  and  learn  from  the  positive \r\nfeatures  of  regulations,  such  as  Security  Directive \r\nPipeline-2021-02C  and  Critical  Entities  Resilience \r\nDirective  (CERD).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"SqqTXhYpMNKsB4NffYvQjXlaFkltQwRQumkHdO3J7iA="},"924d85e4-9f7a-4072-b9bf-ffe639ed768b":{"id_":"924d85e4-9f7a-4072-b9bf-ffe639ed768b","metadata":{"page_number":6,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf_6","metadata":{"page_number":6,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"hash":"cExoG6aeXDTufOs8clWwEavuF54XLDb1BxJWV/u911U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8bbb1b4a-7e5e-4e21-bb87-12b23d6ba851","metadata":{"page_number":6,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"hash":"SqqTXhYpMNKsB4NffYvQjXlaFkltQwRQumkHdO3J7iA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f068ac3c-7f29-4d48-8e3e-33c761d9e01e","metadata":{"page_number":6,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"hash":"ukjgfHdgXeB5C+shMP6BOmk8yOWzqWux8DeH52Dwl5Y="}},"text":"For  example,  by  incorporating \r\nclearer timelines for reporting incidents and expanding \r\nthe definition of reportable incidents, regulators can \r\nensure  that  organizations  are  aware  of  potential \r\nincidents that could adversely affect their business and \r\ncustomers. However, recently, there have been some \r\nnotable improvements in the field of incident reporting. For  instance,  the  Biden-Harris  Administration \r\nunveiled  a  new  National  Cybersecurity  Strategy  on \r\nMarch  2,  2023,  which  aims  to  protect  the  United \r\nStates’ critical digital infrastructure (The White House, \r\n2023). This  strategy  was  developed  in  response  to \r\nseveral cyber threats that posed a significant risk to \r\npublic services in recent years. In particular, “Strategic \r\nObjective 1.4” under this strategy focuses on updating \r\nthe  Federal  Incident  Response  Plans  and  Processes, \r\nwhich  also  includes  enhancing  the  CIRCIA. More \r\nspecifically, according to this objective, the Act will \r\nrequire all critical entities to report cyber incidents to \r\nthe  CISA  “within  hours. ”  Thus,  these  timely \r\nnotifications will enable faster incident response at the \r\nFederal  level. The  road  to  overcoming  incident \r\nreporting  challenges  is  still  long. However,  it  is \r\nessential to advise regulators, either directly or through \r\nindustry  associations,  to  help  improve  regulations \r\ncontinually. Thus, organizations and regulators must \r\nwork together to increase the quality and quantity of \r\ncyber-attack  reporting  and  discuss  regulatory  issues \r\nthrough collaboration and feedback.

The breach is a security incident in which personal and sensitive\r\ndata are exposed to unauthorized individuals, with the potential to incur several privacy concerns. As an example, the French newspaper Le Figaro breached approximately 7.4 billion records that\r\nincluded full names, passwords, and e-mail and physical addresses. To reduce the likelihood and\r\nimpact of such breaches, it is fundamental to strengthen the security efforts against this type of\r\nincident and, for that, it is first necessary to identify patterns of its occurrence, primarily related to\r\nthe number of data records leaked, the affected geographical region, and its regulatory aspects. To\r\nadvance the discussion in this regard, we study a dataset comprising 428 worldwide data breaches\r\nbetween 2018 and 2019, providing a visualization of the related statistics, such as the most affected\r\ncountries, the predominant economic sector targeted in different countries, and the median number\r\nof records leaked per incident in different countries, regions, and sectors. We then discuss the data\r\nprotection regulation in effect in each country comprised in the dataset, correlating key elements of\r\nthe legislation with the statistical findings. As a result, we have identified an extensive disclosure\r\nof medical records in India and government data in Brazil in the time range. Based on the analysis\r\nand visualization, we find some interesting insights that researchers seldom focus on before, and it is\r\napparent that the real dangers of data leaks are beyond the ordinary imagination.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"wfwAzY5Gq0pE03WeltoFH1HT5dCFj2BNfqAoWSbOEAc="},"5e5f9751-62d5-4c81-aed8-0832f5a2ad14":{"id_":"5e5f9751-62d5-4c81-aed8-0832f5a2ad14","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"O0+DEIb2hF37pSwbcfT7rxqNwQwp/Ao9jRXXCEpeRlg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"157866ea-4158-43fb-9980-cb1da4b77808","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"wfwAzY5Gq0pE03WeltoFH1HT5dCFj2BNfqAoWSbOEAc="}},"text":"Finally, this paper\r\ncontributes to the discussion regarding data protection laws and compliance regarding data breaches,\r\nsupporting, for example, the decision process of data storage location in the cloud.

Introduction\r\nIn an information-rich world, data have become a valuable asset for businesses across\r\nall industries [1]. If effectively collected, analyzed, and utilized, data can enhance decision\r\nmaking, optimize operations, and propel business growth, empowering companies to\r\nunderstand customer behavior, personalize marketing campaigns, and develop innovative\r\nproducts and services [2]. This applies to both private entities and the public administration. While the benefits of data are evident, they also conceive associated implications,\r\nparticularly regarding security and data subject privacy [3].

Depending on the type of data stored,\r\nadditional concerns emerge, such as credit card information leakage promoting financial\r\nfrauds [5] and breach of medical records disclosing sensitive diagnosis [6]. Likewise, for companies and public entities, unintentional data disclosure may imply\r\nreputational damages [7], lawsuits [8], and direct financial losses [9]. Due to these impacts,\r\nthe average cost of a data breach in organizations with high-security skills shortages is USD\r\n5.36 million [10]. Because of these repercussions for both the data subjects and the data owner, busi-\r\nnesses and governments must deploy security controls to safeguard sensitive information\r\nfrom unauthorized access, breaches, or misuse [11]. Implementing robust cybersecurity\r\nmeasures, such as encryption, access controls, and regular security audits, is essential to\r\nprotect both the company’s data and the privacy of its customers [12]. Organizations  took  204  days as  the  mean  time to  identify  a  data compromise in\r\n2023, representing only marginal changes from the numbers of previous years [10], which\r\nemphasizes the need for a more efficient deployment of detection mechanisms. For that, an\r\nimproved comprehension of trends in data breaches is necessary. To advance this discussion,\r\nwe conduct a visualization approach for enhancing the understanding of data leak patterns\r\nworldwide, which advances the planning for security control employment. This work\r\nprovides a comprehensive overview of data breaches and offers valuable insights into\r\npreventing and mitigating these incidents. Additionally, the overview of data protection\r\nlaws associated with the observed statistics contributes to the enrichment of the discussion\r\nregarding the regulatory landscape. This paper’s contributions can help organizations and\r\ngovernments of all sizes and industries to protect their data and their customers. A geographical-oriented discussion and statistics visualization related to data compro-\r\nmises is also relevant as the data on the cloud may be stored abroad, and incident trends\r\nand regulatory analysis may be suitable for protecting the data appropriately [13]. As the\r\nfoundation of this study, we use a dataset of data breaches with at least 30,000 affected\r\nrecords  that occurred globally between 2018 and 2019 [14].","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"//goDRT8eNuX+aF08PDgPggAs3H9LsanbGfdeiIA7PU="},"e7728401-6345-40f3-a077-ab0385b0fe83":{"id_":"e7728401-6345-40f3-a077-ab0385b0fe83","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"8ZiCAjt4bo2oiqUbFqMGN7FOR7Dmtc9karVtJHswwPI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f7a12fc6-26a1-447c-b6fc-4c7830316056","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"//goDRT8eNuX+aF08PDgPggAs3H9LsanbGfdeiIA7PU="}},"text":"The remainder of this work is structured as follows:  Section 2 reviews the related\r\nliterature, Section 3 provides a visualization of the statistics regarding the data breaches\r\npresent in the studied dataset, Section 4 discusses some incidents specifically, Section 5\r\nreviews the applicable data protection laws of the affected countries in the dataset, and\r\nSection 6 presents some of the threats to the validity of the study. Section 7 concludes\r\nthe paper. 2. Literature Review\r\nData protection frameworks may not be adequately structured to regulate the collec-\r\ntion and processing of user data using Internet of Things (IoT) devices. For instance, the\r\nEuropean General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) may not properly protect the data\r\nprocessed by this technology [15]. This raises security concerns and users’ privacy issues,\r\nespecially considering the low-security awareness of IoT consumers and the possibility of\r\ndata breaches [16]. Considering the applicability of IoT devices in the healthcare environment [17], medi-\r\ncal records may be leaked, exposing sensitive data such as medical treatments, vaccines\r\ntaken, diagnoses, and exam results. Due to its sensitivity, several authors have studied\r\nbreaches related to these types of data and their implications in the regulatory realm [18,19]. While continuing the analysis of medical privacy violation, statistical visualization\r\nassists in uncovering key insights and trends within these incidents. As an example, it has\r\nbeen observed that healthcare organizations are mainly breached due to hacking activities,\r\nindicating a weakness in the technological countermeasures deployed by companies in this\r\nsector [20]. Alfawzan et al.[21]studied 23 mobile women’s health apps, and evaluated\r\nthem on their privacy and data collection policies, remarking that some of them collect the\r\nuser’s data without consent and that most of them share the data with third parties.

The authors have also remarked that, in the time frame of\r\nthe studied dataset, comprehended between 2005 and 2016, more than half of the data\r\ncompromises affected the healthcare sector, and negligent data exposure happens twice\r\nmore frequently than malicious ones. In addition to incident pattern identification, threat intelligence methods also aim to\r\ngather information on the attacker intentions, trends, and procedures, enabling the organi-\r\nzation to better protect its informational assets [24]. However, the effective implementation\r\nof threat intelligence faces some challenges, such as the complexity of the threat landscape,\r\nthe big data scenario, and the lack of transparency and visibility [25]. As an example of\r\na threat intelligence framework for data breaches, Noor et al.[26]proposed a machine\r\nlearning model that achieved a 92% detection rate, with an average detection time of 0.15 s. Data  disclosure  may  negatively  affect  the  stock  prices  of  the  breached  company,\r\nand its recovery may depend on factors such as its age,  size,  profitability,  and brand\r\nfamiliarity [27]. A tendency of short sellers to exploit prior knowledge of a data breach\r\noccurrence [28] has also been observed. To reduce the frequency and repercussions of a\r\ndata leak, countermeasures must be effectively adopted and tested [11]. Machine learning\r\nalgorithms are also applicable to prevent and deter these incidents [29]. It is also relevant to study the changes in the behavior of data subjects after a breach. It is observed that, after an incident of this type, users of a website seeking extramarital\r\naffairs tend to decrease the messaging frequency and delete their posted pictures, returning\r\nto normal usage after three weeks [30].

Companies also tend to report a data breach in complicated language\r\nand in lengthy paragraphs [32], which may compromise its readability and understanding\r\nby the affected users. On the data protection regulation and beach incidents, Alazab et al.[33]studied the\r\nAustralia’s Notifiable Data Breach scheme, referring to a greater responsibility given to\r\ndata subjects while data protection entities are treated with more leeway.

Authors have also studied privacy and data protection laws within the jurisdiction\r\nof some of the countries mentioned in this work, such as in China [35], in India [36], in\r\nBrazil [37], in Singapore [38], in Israel [39], and in the European Union [40]. 3. Dataset Visualization\r\nThe dataset studied in this paper is provided by  Neto et al.[14]. For the recognition of\r\npatterns of occurrences of data breaches, we present visualizations of the dataset according\r\nto their geographical and economic sector incidence and to their sizes. 3.1. Data Collection Methodology and Considerations\r\nAccording to Neto et al.[14], the database creation was based on publicly available\r\nsources from government entities, security research groups, research entities, and media\r\nreports in several languages. An incident was only included in the dataset if confirmed by\r\nmultiple sources or if a source provided evidence of its occurrence. The incidents were also\r\nfiltered to include exclusively data breaches reported between January 2018 and December\r\n2019 that exposed at least 30,000 records. This resulted in a dataset comprising 428 incidents,","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qlFA0grVRBX5cvmzKQFom3ePqm9Vm5qs7u6wsmOcJKw="},"6b8b85cd-cd76-46c2-a563-867d910ea72c":{"id_":"6b8b85cd-cd76-46c2-a563-867d910ea72c","metadata":{"page_number":4,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_4","metadata":{"page_number":4,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"/rRmoVhwlczriWCTsKbV/m4tEfJWqeTljd5W3hbBeGA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0946ab41-e969-44b7-9457-0647c600a272","metadata":{"page_number":4,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"zcJ3aw72/vvQt9foNE2bLKQ94opIXJFUZi5wSFeS7gE="}},"text":"Data2023,9, 274 of 24\r\nwhich can be accessed through a web page1.

This computing\r\nmodel enables data to be stored across the borders of the customer country,  and new\r\nchallenges emerge, especially related to security and regulation [44].

One of such controls is an effective cryptographic mechanism. The biggest incident\r\nreported in India affected Aadhaar and exposed one billion records in January 2018. This\r\nbreach is categorized as in the medical sector by Neto et al.[14], possibly due to its relation\r\nto health services [56], including vaccines [57], despite Aadhaar being a biometric database\r\nalso used for demographic, financial, and welfare policy entitlement data [58]. According\r\nto the reference linked to the incident in the dataset, Aadhaar actually suffered multiple\r\nbreaches between 2017 and 2018, which may be due to known vulnerabilities, such as\r\ncryptographic issues observed in the system [59]. As countermeasures, besides a stronger\r\nencryption scheme, Tyagi et al.[60]also suggest the adoption of security testing, the creation\r\nof a Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), and a more effective integration with\r\nthe private sector and their standards. Following the implementation of these controls, the\r\nauthors also recommend initiating open security challenges. There were two reported incidents in Japan, both within the business sector. The\r\nlargest  involved  Toyota,  which  experienced  a  breach  affecting  over  3  million  records\r\nin  2019.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"9dz3hUgnVAnlK8qdw6MLHf90zqlls8Hi0PhexDVZ49k="},"dc9b0c57-abb3-411b-b2ab-1639b9e6cc33":{"id_":"dc9b0c57-abb3-411b-b2ab-1639b9e6cc33","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_10","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"cZLTHqImdgCO2ljG8TkmLl/bSiBSajk/uEhH4JedjMA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"821eab72-a7a5-4725-a153-5f446246cc1e","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"9dz3hUgnVAnlK8qdw6MLHf90zqlls8Hi0PhexDVZ49k="}},"text":"This  case  draws  attention  to  the  expanding  field  of  self-driving  cars,  which\r\nrequire big data for effectiveness and penalization [61].

Accord-\r\ning to the official portal of the Brazilian Ministry of Health2, the incident occurred due to\r\nthe leakage of an access credential to the system. This compromised personal data such as\r\nthe individual taxpayer registry number, name, mother’s name, gender, race, date of birth,\r\nblood type, nationality, and date of death. The sensitiveness of this data, along with the the\r\nattack vector on this case, reinforces the importance of a secure credential storage with the\r\nuse of strong hashing and salting algorithms [63], multi-factor authentication [64], and a\r\npassword breach alerting system [65]. Additionally, to enhance identity protection, the use of common passwords should\r\nbe avoided. The Zynga breach in 2019, in the United States, exposed 218 million records,\r\nand revealed that the most used passwords included strings such aspassword,12345,\r\nchangeme, andqwerty[66]. The enforcement of a password policy, requiring more secure\r\npasswords, should be employed. Additionally, security awareness programs may also\r\nimprove the security on both the user’s and the employee’s end, reducing the use of weak\r\npasswords and the likelihood of successful phishing campaigns [67]. Adversarial Tactics and Techniques Framework\r\nFor the application of more tailored security controls and for more efficiently mit-\r\nigating breach risks, a threat intelligence program may be necessary [68]. To assist in\r\nthis task, the MITRE ATT&CK, a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques,\r\nis a valid framework for threat modeling and the efficient employment of data breach\r\ncountermeasures considering the observed malicious behavior [69]. This structure organizes the security knowledge into hierarchies. It presents several\r\nadversarial techniques categorized into 14 tactics, which are namely reconnaissance, re-\r\nsource development, initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense\r\nevasion, credential access, discovery, lateral movement, collection, command and control,\r\nexfiltration, and impact. Each of these tactics comprise different techniques that may be\r\nused by attackers to achieve their goals.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"h5eDt+9ryFtdRhMLSUz5fCs71tk9mCvY5tN4YFgceLM="},"ae5e9fc1-5403-4885-b243-bce44cd43a86":{"id_":"ae5e9fc1-5403-4885-b243-bce44cd43a86","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_11","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"LKKF4X7W6mfS6kDk32N5/vP6liBqk90NQlr/fyi187M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e172f359-ee91-4569-a15a-924c2e3db58b","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"h5eDt+9ryFtdRhMLSUz5fCs71tk9mCvY5tN4YFgceLM="}},"text":"Each of these tactics comprise different techniques that may be\r\nused by attackers to achieve their goals.

Data Protection Regulation\r\nGiven the sensitiveness of personal data, its collection, processing, storage, use, and\r\ndestruction must be carefully planned. For enforcing this planning, data protection laws\r\nregulate the privacy of the data subjects [70]. 5.1. Regulatory Measures for Mitigating Data Breaches\r\nA data protection legislation aims to assist in mitigating data leaks by means that\r\nmandate the adoption of preventive security mechanisms. It also aims to reduce the\r\nimpact caused by leaks through timely notifications to regulatory authorities, enabling\r\nappropriate actions to be taken [71]. In this latter scenario, established laws and regulatory\r\nframeworks assist in risk mitigation for both companies and the public sector. Regulations\r\nare commonly rooted in principles such as prevention, accountability, and transparency,\r\nproviding measures to prevent breaches and means to identify and account the responsible\r\nparties. Thus,  principled  interpretations  should  already  aid  in  reducing  incidents  or\r\nmitigating risks, even if a norm is not robust and lacks explicit provisions for data protection,\r\nprocessing, or breach notifications.

Each scenario involves a distinct interpretation and adaptation to the\r\ntypes of leaks occurring, making certain tools more suitable for certain countries. However,\r\nelements like notification and the impact report should be common guidelines across all\r\nregulations concerning data breaches. In some countries, specific regulations exist for specific types of data. In the United\r\nStates, for example, the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) regulates data security in publicly listed\r\ncompanies [72], the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA) in financial organizations, [73], the\r\nFederal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) in the U.S. federal government\r\nagencies [74], the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) in education or-\r\nganizations [75], and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) related to\r\nchildren [76]. However, this work focuses on federal-level data protection laws, and we do\r\nnot discuss sectoral regulations such as the aforementioned. As a reiteration of the importance of data protection legislation, Table 2 compares\r\nthe distribution of data breach costs in lowly and highly regulated environments. The\r\nfinancial impacts of a security breach typically oscillate over time after the incident due\r\nto costs at different stages of the response, such as identification, containment, recovery,\r\nand repair [10]. A more evenly distributed cost, observed in highly regulated areas, will\r\ndilute the financial damage over time, facilitating the subsistence of the organization.

Regulation Levels in the Breached Countries\r\nTo identify the regions that are lowly and highly regulated regarding data protection\r\nand privacy, we briefly compare aspects of the pertinent legislation of all the countries\r\npresent within the dataset. Table 3 summarizes this comparison, in which the rows are\r\nsorted descending by the sum of records leaked. The column ‘Regulation and enforcement’\r\npresents the level of regulation of the country, according to [77], in which (++) represents a\r\nheavy regulation, (+) a robust regulation, (−) moderate, and (−−) limited. A possible analysis for revealing whether legislation is effective in incident mitigation\r\nis a comparison between the frequency and costs of data breaches before and after the\r\nlaw’s enforcement, or even examining how the data protection authority acts in cases of\r\noccurring leaks, the existence of easy notification channels, assessing the impact that these\r\nleaks had on individuals and whether affected people were informed, and adhering to\r\ntransparency and accountability duties.

The law addresses the reparation by the controller or processor that,\r\ndue to the processing of personal data, causes patrimonial, moral, individual, or collective\r\ndamages in violation of the legislation. Thus, non-compliance with good practices, security,\r\nand prevention as envisaged by the law would necessitate damage reparation in the event\r\nof a data leak. Article 48 specifically addresses the notification by the controller of security\r\nincidents to the national authority (ANPD), which may entail risks or relevant harm to data\r\nsubjects. The provision outlines the minimum requirements: (i) description of the nature of\r\nthe affected personal data; (ii) information about the involved data subjects; (iii) indication\r\nof technical and security measures used to protect the data, observing trade and industrial\r\nsecrets; (iv) risks related to the incident; (v) reasons for delay if the communication was\r\nnot immediate; and (vi) measures taken or to be taken to reverse or mitigate the damage\r\neffects. There is no legal deadline for incident notifications to the ANPD. However, the\r\nauthority published guidelines in 2021 stating that communication should be made within\r\ntwo business days from the date of becoming aware of the incident. The institutional\r\nwebsite contains instructions for this notification3, with updated guidelines on violations. In  the  case  of  significant  risk  or  harm  to  data  subjects,  individuals  may  also  need  to\r\nbe notified. The notification can be sent by the Data Protection Officer (DPO) or the\r\nlegal representative, along with the corresponding documentation or authorization. An\r\nadditional recommendation, not legally required, is the implementation of contractual\r\nclauses establishing notification obligations between controllers and processors to expedite\r\nassessment and minimize risks to data subjects. Although it is not necessary to provide a\r\nlist of affected data subjects, the ANPD may request the data controller to present a copy of\r\nthe notification to the data subjects about the breach. This notification to the data subject\r\nshould be made individually, whenever possible, and can be carried out by any means,\r\nsuch as e-mail, letter, or electronic message.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ls0+4eIUK34Vx0lMf83zVv3VCxW739hP+uZr8QGoC6s="},"a1cd4dc6-b9ab-4e4c-b612-d6a1c7a7da9f":{"id_":"a1cd4dc6-b9ab-4e4c-b612-d6a1c7a7da9f","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_14","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"tvE3SOQmV0+T8MjWrRKuLqWSPt0Yy77QYIEv1vBENgI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"32c210f4-5fec-4deb-b3c6-a0f8d4163104","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"ls0+4eIUK34Vx0lMf83zVv3VCxW739hP+uZr8QGoC6s="}},"text":"The Indian Law Personal Data Protection Bill in 2019 (PDP), still undergoing updates\r\nin 2022 and considered as a limited regulation (–), was enacted after the Indian Supreme\r\nCourt in 2017 recognized privacy as a fundamental right, enshrined in Article 21 of the\r\nConstitution [77]. There is still no established data protection authority,  which might\r\ncompromise the law’s applicability in data breach construction and mitigation. As observed, both European and Japanese regulations encompass data protection\r\nmeasures concerning prevention, audit, and notification. They also ensure compliance and\r\noversight of legal requirements through national data protection authorities. In contrast,\r\nBrazil, despite modeling its national law after the GDPR and anticipating similar provisions,\r\nremains in a relatively immature regulatory landscape. This is exemplified by the previous\r\nattachment of the national data protection authority to the Presidency of the Republic,\r\nwhich led to increased subordination and limited autonomy in law enforcement [79]. Only\r\nin 2022 did the ANPD gain more autonomy by attaching to the Brazilian Ministry of Justice\r\nand Public Security, albeit without subordination. Conversely, India’s data protection law\r\nwas enacted in 2023 and is yet to be fully implemented [80]. Moreover, the absence of a\r\ndata protection authority underscores its significant immaturity. Consequently, despite the\r\nexistence of laws and security requirements, the lack of effective enforcement, monitoring,\r\nand penalization mechanisms impedes the effective enforcement of data protection. These\r\nmaturity issues are among the possible causes for the classification of Brazil’s and India’s\r\ndata protection regulations at lower levels when compared to Europe’s and Japan’s, for\r\nexample. The United States, despite also not having an enacted federal-level data protection\r\nlaw nor a data protection authority, is considered a country of heavy regulation; this may\r\nbe due to the enactment of the sector-specific laws mentioned in Section 5 and the passing\r\nof state-level data protection laws [81], which demonstrate a greater maturity of the data\r\nprotection regulation in the United States.

A comparison of the maturity levels between the geographical regions, expressed\r\nby the regulation and enforcement levels, is then presented in Figure 11. It is observed\r\nthat all countries in Europe, North America, and Africa apply heavy regulations, while all\r\ncountries in South America and the Caribbean are moderately regulated. Asia Pacific is the\r\nmost diverse region, as it also comprehends a greater number of countries in the dataset. Figure 11.Classification level of regulation and enforcement for countries per region [77]. It is also noted that the Asia Pacific, the only region to have a country with limited\r\nregulation in the dataset, is also the region with a greater median of records breached per\r\nincident, according to Figure 5, with a close value to the median in Europe, a strongly\r\nregulated region. The North America, which is also strongly regulated, presents the lowest\r\nmedian value. When analyzing the median values in countries, from Figure 3, it is observed\r\nthat the top countries are heavily regulated. From this, it may be inferred that regulation\r\nlevels and breach sizes are not strongly correlated. In fact, the amount of data leaked is\r\nmore strongly related to the amount of data stored by the organization. The nature of the\r\nstored data may also influence the breach size, as organizations may apply more efforts\r\nto secure more sensitive data, which could be more severely penalized by data protection\r\nlaws. As an example, medical-related data presented the second lowest median values, as\r\nseen in Figure 6. Following an analysis of Table 3, which is sorted by the sum of breach sizes divided\r\nby the populations sizes in 2019, it is observed that countries with greater regulation and\r\nenforcement levels are more concentrated in the superior lines, which suggests that these\r\ncountries breach a greater number of records per inhabitant than those of lower levels. This\r\nmay be due to several factors. One of them is that developed countries, like the United\r\nStates and those in Europe, are more likely to offer more data-related services, such as cloud\r\nstorage, even for non-residents, which increases the chances of breaches. It may also be a\r\ndirect consequence of a more significant enforcement of breach notification.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"NPZFaHfiaj75y8ADt3BW1MUJ0mhgKpHjbggTIDw0GN4="},"d3648096-fe9b-4e53-bad7-cac7d1b16732":{"id_":"d3648096-fe9b-4e53-bad7-cac7d1b16732","metadata":{"page_number":15,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_15","metadata":{"page_number":15,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"jOubtHjIPIxiGnAUHFx9qQcbatlgT0luEsZP7OBSLZE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4fca314b-8784-4f83-80b9-2344579bb72a","metadata":{"page_number":15,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"NPZFaHfiaj75y8ADt3BW1MUJ0mhgKpHjbggTIDw0GN4="}},"text":"It may also be a\r\ndirect consequence of a more significant enforcement of breach notification.

It is noteworthy\r\nthat while Iran is classified as having limited regulation and enforcement regarding data\r\nprotection and privacy, the United States is categorized as a heavily regulated country,\r\npossibly due to the reasons stated in Section 5.2. Moreover, some Member States of the European Union had a national data protection\r\nlaw in effect before the General Data Protection Regulation, some of which still coexist with\r\nthe GDPR. Examples include France’s Loi Informatique et Libertés [85] and Germany’s\r\nBundesdatenschutzgesetz [86].

As\r\nan example, the GDPR defines personal data as any information relating to an identified\r\nor identifiable natural person,  such as name,  date of birth,  email address,  and billing\r\naddress [77]. Brazil’s LGPD does not classify anonymized data as personal information\r\nunless it can be reversed by applying reasonable efforts [77]. Sensitive data may also be defined.

Figure 15 shows the distribution of countries that require data\r\nbreach notification and, among those who do, whether they specify a time limit or not. It is also noteworthy that countries like Chile and Seychelles, although being among the\r\nthree countries with the fewest records breached, do not require notification and, therefore,\r\nmight be under-reporting incidents [92]. Figure 15.Distribution of countries that require breach notification and specify a time limit. 5.3.4. Other Aspects\r\nData protection is a complex matter, and we do not intend to present an exhaustive\r\ncomparison of regulation in these countries but rather discuss some key elements of them. Hereof, the transfer requirements determine the legal aspects that an organization must\r\ncomply with when on-shoring and offshoring data. Especially when transferring data\r\nabroad, additional obligations must be fulfilled. In this scenario, Israeli law mandates that\r\nthe laws of the destination country provide a level of data protection no less stringent than\r\nthat afforded by Israeli law [77]. If that is not the case, at least one of the other criteria must\r\nbe met, such as the data subject’s consent, whether the transfer is vital to public safety,\r\nor others [77]. For enforcement, the public competent entity may apply sanctions to non-compliant\r\norganizations, such as stopping data collection, destruction of personal data collected, and\r\nfinancial penalties in Singapore [77]. The Turkish Criminal Code also punishes a person\r\nwho illegally collects, transfers, publishes, or deletes data with imprisonment [77]. Data protection laws may also apply to electronic marketing. One example of such an\r\napplication is Malaysia’s PDPA, which states that any data subject may require their data\r\nto cease or not to begin processing for direct marketing purposes [77]. 6. Threats to Validity\r\nThe conclusions of this study face threats regarding their validity,  which may be\r\nclassified into four types [93]. External validity. The dataset may have been generated focusing on incidents that\r\nhappened in specific regions, such as countries with greater economies or that may be more\r\nrepresentative in the media. Less publicized breaches that meet the dataset criteria could\r\nhave been omitted. Although the dataset incorporates sources from several languages [14],\r\nthe language barrier also poses a potential external threat to validity.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"D1hD2HCDhWbM9WW+T0llgCns2fC2++MF39XNEqHgNhU="},"c1f482ec-cb6c-4bfd-bda5-e468cd6c7d5c":{"id_":"c1f482ec-cb6c-4bfd-bda5-e468cd6c7d5c","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_18","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"oCAolUrDCWqHYdNgy1xNO6mt+Ukqcy5y7s7xq3Rp0Zk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9ce5c649-625e-4944-b0f8-87930677a094","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"D1hD2HCDhWbM9WW+T0llgCns2fC2++MF39XNEqHgNhU="}},"text":"This limitation might\r\nresult in less comprehensive coverage of less frequently spoken languages, leading to\r\npotential under-representation of breaches in those linguistic scenarios.

Additionally, the casual relationship between regulation level\r\nin a country and the frequency and impact of a data leak within its jurisdiction is not\r\nalways clear, as other factors, such as population size, may also influence the metrics on\r\nthese incidents. Construct validity. Countries have different definitions for personal data and what\r\nconstitutes a data breach. This threatens the consistency of the incidents between regions. Moreover, a data protection regulation is rich in details and nuances that were not deeply\r\nexplored, potentially affecting the comparability between the discussed regulatory aspects\r\nand the related data violations. Conclusion validity. The dataset may suffer from under-reporting,  especially in\r\ncountries where data breach notification was not legally required between 2018 and 2019. Despite these threats, this study provides valuable insights and promotes the discus-\r\nsion regarding compliance and data protection in the affected countries during the dataset\r\ntime range. 7. Conclusions and Future Work\r\nThis research aimed to visualize worldwide data breaches, especially related to their\r\ngeographical and economic sector occurrences. For that, we used a dataset comprising\r\nthis type of incident that happened between 2018 and 2019 that leaked 30,000 records or\r\nmore [14]. In addition to that, we provided a regulatory discussion in the scope of the\r\naffected countries. This study explores the correlation between data protection enforcement levels and\r\ndata breach occurrences and impacts, and also compares key elements between differ-\r\nent levels of regulations, potentially guiding policy enhancements for improving global\r\ndata protection. Furthermore, these findings can offer valuable insights for organizations\r\nadopting data storage solutions, such as cloud computing models, by aiding in informed\r\ndecisions about where to store sensitive data, considering the nature of the data,the location\r\nof the storage, and its data protection regulation level and history of data confidentiality issues. This investigation identified several strong relationships between countries and eco-\r\nnomic sectors affected by data breaches, such as India, and the medical or healthcare sector;\r\nand Brazil, and the government or military sector. We also observed that leaks affecting\r\neducation records affected North America exclusively in this time frame. A correlation with\r\nthe regulatory aspects in these countries and regions may promote the recognition of root\r\ncauses for data violations and mitigation strategies.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"nIU/OfvaOzVmSrv4PXJCDT0NtsEpOtXfdviAqYJpkPo="},"0328ac1f-0e0a-4f15-8d02-3012945b3ffd":{"id_":"0328ac1f-0e0a-4f15-8d02-3012945b3ffd","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_19","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"F7neJo8ypdnSpZmXG2vCZVMPu4u98G1WZgdyGRCYLqA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"59759d44-045d-47a8-9ad2-f15b0d78de19","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"nIU/OfvaOzVmSrv4PXJCDT0NtsEpOtXfdviAqYJpkPo="}},"text":"It is relevant to mention, however, that\r\nthese findings heavily rely on the dataset used. Despite the seemingly robust methodology\r\nin data collection, the potential threats to its validity must be considered. These limitations\r\nmight hinder the representation of reality. Given that these patterns are subject to change over time, we propose future research\r\nto extend this study to encompass a broader time frame to validate the aforementioned\r\ndiscoveries. Future work may also enrich the dataset used, including a field that informs\r\nthe cause of the data breach, which would enable a more in-depth discussion regarding\r\nmitigation techniques and the identification of patterns of adversarial procedures per geo-\r\ngraphical region. This enriched dataset could subsequently be fed into machine learning\r\nalgorithms to uncover deeper correlations and predict future occurrences of data leaks. Future research may also focus on the countermeasures, providing more extensive discus-\r\nsion about security controls that may mitigate risks associated to data exposures. On the\r\nregulatory aspects, future work may also compare the impact of the enactment of data\r\nprotection laws on security incidents by analyzing the occurrence of incidents before and\r\nafter they started effects. Overall, the research provides a valuable contribution to the understanding of data\r\nbreaches and their implications for organizations and policymakers. The identified patterns\r\nand correlations can inform data security practices and regulatory frameworks, while the\r\nproposed future research can further advance our knowledge of this critical issue.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"1z3SMYQOPA61mRs7aCkGwDvuw1Z/WUN919lOBfRjJ+w="},"900ecba4-7dbd-4722-b08c-b02f9286a3ec":{"id_":"900ecba4-7dbd-4722-b08c-b02f9286a3ec","metadata":{"page_number":20,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_20","metadata":{"page_number":20,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"3o1CRs1EUCcUkXvPBDsMEIvP63E/sWzjUGotXWZ75Z0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"374ecb11-cd0f-4340-8fa8-73503f5f601e","metadata":{"page_number":20,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"tDFwrzFMKuVt5lvJGH6jljMdis6JLw3JBC4OI6MEdhI="}},"text":"Data2023,9, 2720 of 24\r\nAuthor Contributions:G.A.P.R., A.L.M.S. and R.d.O.A. conceived the general composition of the data\r\nbreach study; A.N.L.E.L. conducted the analysis on the data protection laws; E.D.C. and F.L.L.d.M. indicated the methods for the data exploratory analysis; A.L.S.O. and L.J.G.V. conceived and designed\r\nthe experiment.
